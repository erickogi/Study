<h2>Methods and Techniques of Preservation Management</h2>
<h3><a name="preventive">Preventive Preservation</a></h3>

<p>Preventive preservation seeks to create an ideal environment which as far as is possible prevents or slows down deterioration and in so doing helps to preserve the physical and chemical integrity of materials.
</p>
<p>The effectiveness of this approach depends very much on the knowledge of the characteristics of information materials in the custody of the concerned information center and the factors and agents that are most likely to cause deterioration
 </p>
<p>However, if preventive methods or strategies of preservation are put in place early enough, it is possible that conservation can be avoided or at least minimized
 </p>
<p>Preventive preservation therefore involves putting in place various protective measures that will pre-empt the many forms of deterioration
</p>
<p>It may include a variety of measures as follows:
 </p>
<p>• Taking proper care of the building which houses the information materials;
</p>
<p>• Providing adequate storage facilities
</p>
<p>• Providing direct physical protection 
 </p>
<p>• Ensuring proper environmental controls; and adopting Integrated Pest Management Strategies.
</p>
<h4><a name="buildingstandards">Building Standards</a></h4>
<p>Information center buildings must be designed and constructed in a manner that provides an ideal environment for the storage and preservation of information materials as well as for the comfort of staff and users
 </p>
<p>One important consideration for the siting of such buildings is that the site must be free from the risks of infestation by insects, rodents, flooding, dust, pollution and civil strife.
</p>
<p>Storage areas should not be situated in basements of buildings. If this is done for security and other reasons, environmental conditions must be regulated to make them ideal for the storage and preservation of materials
 </p>
<p>The costs for creating such artificial environments may be prohibitive for many information centres and must be thought of carefully beforehand
</p>
<p>There are two types of buildings for the storage and preservation of information materials
</p>
<p>• Purpose-built (specifically planned and designed)
</p>
<p>• Converted buildings (planned and designed for other purposes)
</p>
<p>The purpose-built buildings often have all the required facilities and environmental conditions to meet the storage needs of information materials
</p>
<p>The converted buildings will pose storage problems since the right specifications for the storage of information materials were not considered and must therefore be provided for irrespective of the costs involved
</p>
<p>A building intended to house information materials must meet a series of building standards that protect both the life of the staff and also the information materials
 </p>
<p>Such standard include: all materials used for walls, the foundations and the roof must be fire-proof;
 </p>
<p>• The building must meet proper thermal installation standards
</p>
<p>• Storage areas must be sited away from areas of direct sunlight
</p>
<p>• Storage areas must be fitted with fireproof doors
</p>
<p>• There must be emergency exists for easy evacuation of materials and of staff in case of disasters (fire)
</p>
<p>• Roofs should be completely water proof and burglar proof
</p>
<p>• No pipes should pass through storage areas to minimize accumulation of water vapour (humidity)
</p>
<p>• Security alarms, fire alarms, burglar alarms, smoke detectors, gas detectors etc should be fitted
</p>
<p>• Equipment such as fire extinguishers should also be fitted, these should regularly be checked and serviced and the staff be trained on their use.
</p>
<p>• Fire drills should also be done periodically to check the alertness of the staff and users and consequently raise awareness on disaster preparedness on both the staff and the users
</p>


<h3><a name="intergratedpestmanagment">Integrated Pest Management</a></h3>
<p>It is a well known fact that biological agents including rodents, termites, silverfish, cockroaches, booklice and beetles are a problem and damage information materials in various ways
</p>
<p>Pests find their way to repositories some times as part of incoming materials (archival records) or on their own through the finest of inlets.
</p>
<p>Many information centres have spent a lot of resources through the purchase of over the counter chemical products such pesticides and fungicides in order to control biological pests but without much success
</p>
<p>Some experts point out that what chemical products do it merely to create super pests that are resistant to pesticides
</p>
<p>The harmful effect of pesticides used in fumigation to humans has further discouraged their use especially in developed countries where these have been banned from use</p>
<p>As a result new methods of controlling pests without the use of pesticides have emerged
</p>
<p>One example is known as the “least chemical approach” commonly referred to as Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
</p>
<p>IPM involves controlling conditions in and around storage buildings, controlling the micro-climate of the storage areas, cleaning archival documents before integrating with those in the repository and understanding the insect life cycle or habits
</p>
<p>The whole idea about IPM is therefore to forestall or pre-empt treatment before infestation by biological agents which would end up with fumigation having to take place.
</p>
<p><b>The IPM strategy involves various measures including:
</b></p>
<p>• Regular monitoring of pest activity and understanding insect lifecycles with recognition that the larvae stage is the most damaging </p>
<p>• Checking of all information materials especially archival materials before it enters the repository
</p>
<p>• Use of mouse and rat traps in place of toxic chemicals which kill them in ceilings or cracks of walls thus providing food for other insects pests such as the carpet bettle
</p>
<p>• Clearing all bushes and plant debri from the exterior of storage buildings which ends up controlling the entry of cockroaches, rats or mice
</p>
<p>• Elimination of damp condition which helps control silverfish and other pests such as mould
</p>
<p>• Placing silica gel in the repository
</p>
<p>• Good housekeeping practices to remove dust, dead insects, and similar food nutrients for biological pests
</p>
<p>• Use of sticky traps to catch insects
</p>
<h3><a name="prescriptive">Prescriptive Preservation</a></h3>
<p>Conservation treatment involves direct intervention with information materials to render them as physically and chemically stable as possible. 
 </p>
<p>The degree of intervention depends on the nature of the materials, their condition, value, and anticipated uses as well as on institutional resources.
</p>
<p>Given the expense, individual conservation treatment is often reserved for records of the highest value.
</p>
<h3><a name="treatmentapproaches">Treatment Approaches</a></h3>
<p>•Mass conservation procedures are seen by some as the most viable hope for long-term keeping of large archival, manuscript, and library collection.
 </p>
<p>• In theory, mass procedures allow high volume treatment of materials evidencing the same problem; individual handling is thus minimized and the cost of treatment per item radically reduced.
</p>
<p>• Examples of such measures include: deacidification; fumigation and paper strengthening techniques 
</p>
<p>• Archival materials are less likely candidates for most mass than are library materials given the eclectic nature of archival collections and the great diversity of materials and formats that can be encountered in even a single archives box.
