<h4><a name="conservationtechniques">Other Conservation Techniques</a></h4>
<p><strong>Tissue Repairs</strong>- Japanese tissue paper is used to reinforce both sides of a document. 
 </p>
<p>• Its advantage is seen in the speed of treatment and the fact that it does not require specialized skills.
</p>
<p>• It is also transparent and thus can be used in documents written on both sides
</p>
<p>• It is reversible
</p>
<p><strong>Lamination –</strong> a document is sand-witched between a japanese tissue paper and cellulose acitate film either by hand or by use of a laminating machine
 </p>
<p>• If done by machine, the heat used is harmful to documents
</p>
<p>• It is quite difficult to reverse lamination and where a machine is used it is fairly expensive</p>
<p><strong>Full Pasting –</strong> Hand made paper is used to reinforce a document and give it protection. It is only used in documents written on one side since the hand made paper is not transparent
</p>
<p>• It is not time consuming
</p>
<p><strong>Leaf Casting –</strong> This involves the repair of a document by filling in the missing areas with paper pulp.
</p>
<p>• The area in a document which requires to be filled with pulped requires some calculation so that the process of filling does not create new holes or a new layer of pulp on the surface of a document
</p>
<p>• The leaf casting machine is very expensive and the process very slow
</p>
<p><strong>In-laying</strong> - (in-framing) – This is used to repair small sized documents especially damaged on the edges by termites. 
</p>
<p>• A document is protected on both sides by hand paper and japanese tissue paper
</p>
<p><b>Mounting –</b> Maps and charts are reinforced by mounting them on a white cotton material.
 </p>
<p>• Because of their sizes map presents storage problems thus map sectioning is called for or is necessary before mounting
</p>
<p><b>Binding –</b> This is the permanent fastening usually between covers to keep a document in a fixed order and to assist in protecting them. It enables a document to stand on the shelf in perfectly staple non sagging position and allows it to be opened easily to facilitate reading and copying 
</p>
<p><b>Chiffon repair – </b>This technique is similar to tissue repair but it is used to repair maps and other oversized documents. The document is sand witched between two pieces of chiffon clothes
</p>
<p><b>Encapsulation –</b> This involves trapping a document between two sheets of polyester material which is then shielded or fastened at the edges. The process differs from lamination since the document is not stack to the encapsulating material</p>
