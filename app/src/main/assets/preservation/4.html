<h3>Reformatting</h3>
<p>When information materials are extremely fragile, heavily used, deteriorating or highly valuable, it is a common practice to have them reformatted to alternative media the most common being microfilming and digitizing
</p>
<p>The choice of the media to adopt depends on the following factors:
</p>
<h4>Purpose for format conversion</h4>
 
<p>This should be clear since different formats may be suitable for different purpose. It should be considered for example whether the purpose is:
 </p>
<p>• Substitution where the  new version replacing a deteriorated version;
 </p>
<p>• Security where the new version provides a back up to a rear or unique material;
</p>
<p>• Compaction  where a new version replaces a bulky original e.g. news  papers;
</p>
<p>• Conservation where a new version is used for normal reference;
</p>
<p>• Dissemination where many copies of the new version is made available for use at many different locations.
</p>

<h4>User needs 
</h4>
<p>• Several questions will have to be answered with regard to user needs before choosing a media:
</p>
<p>• The ease  with which users will be able to identify, retrieve and interpreter the information held in the new media;
</p>
<p>• How urgently users located in far way locations may be able to retrieve such information;
</p>
<p>• The volume of access to information  that is anticipated
</p>

<h4>Technical issues
</h4>
<p>This relates to the following:
</p>
<p>• Life expectancy of the new media. This is important in order to reduce the cost associated with migration into a different medium in the future;
</p>
<p>• Special preservation measures to ensures the physical safety of the new media;
</p>
<p>• The extent to  which a specific technological system is essential for access to information in the new format(media) i.e H/Ware and S/ware dependency;
</p>
<p>• The existence of standards that promote confidence in the quality of the new format i.e standards  for facilitating further format conversion on changing of technology as well as standards  for the physical preservation  of the media.
</p>
<h4>Relative costs
</h4>
<p>This includes: 
</p>
<p>• The cost of conversion to secondary format;
</p>
<p>• The cost  of maintenance and storage of the new media;
</p>
<p>• Costs associated with access to information;
</p>
<p>• Costs of re- conversion to another format in the event of technological obsolescence;
</p>
<p>• Costs of equipment, materials, personnel e.t.c required.

</p>
<h4>Nature & Variety of Materials
</h4>
<p>It is important to decide whether the following materials will be included in the format conversion programs.
 </p>
<p>• Printed books </p>
<p>• Non-textual Information materials e.g.  audio visual
</p>
<p>• Manuscripts 
</p>
<p>• Archives
</p>
