<h3>Storage and Handling Materials in Different Formats</h3>
<p>• Information centres are known to house a wide variety of information materials.
</p>
<p>• Although these materials require a basic standard of care, some would require more attention and protection because they are difficult or impossible to replace.
</p>
<p>• Good storage of the information materials in a risk-free environment is one of the most important actions that can be taken.
</p>


<h4><a name="paper">Paper Records and cartographic records</a>
</h4>
<p>This include any documented information on a paper base including such materials as maps and plans on paper backing.
</p>
<p>• Ideally they should be kept in total darkness but since this is rarely achievable then exposure to light should be limited to the shortest time possible.
 </p>
<p>• When exhibiting such materials light levels should be kept as low as possible ideally not more that 50 lux.
</p>
<p>• Ideal temp. and humidity levels should be between 18 to 20 degrees Celsius and 35-45% respectively
</p>
<p>• Particular care should be taken when handling large items such as maps.
 </p>
<p>• Folded papers should be flattened if possible since repeated folding will break down the strength of the paper speeding up deterioration
</p>
<p>• Ideally, paper archives should be stored in acid-free file folders with a thickness of not more than 1-2 centimeters of  documents per folder.
</p>
<p>• It is best to keep archives in acid free boxes to keep out water, light, predators and dust. If acid-free boxes are not available, any boxes are better than none
</p>
<p>• If boxes are not available the records can be wrapped in unbleached cotton cloth or tied with unbleached cotton tape. 
</p>
<p>• They should never be stored in containers that once held any kind of food products
</p>
<p>• If a particular paper records are in high demand, the institution should consider making copies and using these for reference or copying rather than exposing originals to continued light and handling.
</p>


<h4><a name="books">Books and other publications</a>
</h4>
<p>• Some books and publications are more easily replaceable but others are rare and perhaps unique.
</p>
<p>• Books can be made of a variety of materials including paper, leather, vellum, cloth, boards and adhesives. 
</p>
<p>• In general the temp recommended for paper materials applies equally to books.
</p>
<p>• However they require slightly higher RH of about 45-50% but should be kept away from excess RH
 </p>
<p>• They are best kept in an environment as dark as possible and should be protected from strong light as well (50 lux or less)
</p>
<p>• They should be removed from shelves carefully without pulling on the spine.
</p>
<p>• When opening a book it should not be pressed flat
</p>
<p>• They should be stored upright if possible unless it is particularly fragile
</p>
<p>• Extremely fragile books could be stored in boxes or tied with cotton tape.
</p>
<p>• Damaged books should never be repaired using adhesive tapes or glues
</p>

<h4><a name="parchment">Parchment and  vellum</a>
<p>• These are resistant to acid attack because of the nature of their manufacture.
</p>
<p>• They are durable if stored correctly but very susceptible to extremes and fluctuations of RH
</p>
<p>• They should be exposed to as little light as possible
</p>
<p>• Temp of 18 – 20 or cooler are agreeable, RH of 50 – 55%  are best and fluctuations should be avoided as much as possible
</p>
<p>• They should be stored in boxes, drawers or on shelve inside strong file folders
</p>
<p>• They should be unfolded, flat and under minimal pressure
</p>
<h4><a name="newspapers">Newspapers</a>
</h4>
<p>These are physically very unstable and an exceptionally poor medium for long term preservation
</p>
<p>• The best course of action would be to microfilm them and preserve the original if necessary.
</p>
<p>• If the original are kept they should be stored out of any light as acidic paper will deteriorate even more quickly when exposed to light, heat or excessively dry air.
</p>
<p>• Temp should be below 20 degrees Celcius and RH of 40-45%
</p>
<p>• They should be kept in a made to measure acid-free boxes. 
</p>
<p>• Alternatively, they should be wrapped in acid-free paper and stored separately from other materials.
</p>
<p>• The box or wrapping should be clearly marked so that it is easy to retrieve the correct bundle when necessary.
</p>
<p>• Binding them is to be discouraged as this makes future preservation work much more difficult and ultimately accelerates deterioration.
</p>


<h4><a name="art">Works of Art on Paper</a>
</h4>
<p>This include such materials as oil paintings, watercolors or  other artistic items
 </p>
<p>•	These materials are either framed or unframed. If framed, they should be left within their frames unless the frames are highly acidic or are causing damage to the paper within.
</p>
<p>• Framed items can be hung on an interior wall away from sunlight or any source of heat. They should hung securely so that they are well supported on the wall ideally from two points.
</p>
<p>• Unframed items are best stored in a box or container that does not put extra pressure on the surface but protects the item from dust and light.
</p>
<p>• If framed paintings cannot be hung, then they should be stacked upright in a secure area.
</p>
<p>• They should be rested on a piece of cotton cloth or carpet and separated with good quality heavy cardboard to protect the frames and glass.
</p>
<p>• Alternatively a wooden storage rack can be built with slots in it to hold framed materials and keep them separate from other items.
</p>
<p>• Light levels for storage and display should be lower than 150 lux
</p>
<p>• The best temp is 18-20 degree Celsius and RH of 45 and 55% which should remain as stable as possible.
</p>
<p>• When handling these materials, they should never be touched on the surface and no attempt should be made to clean them other than gently dusting them with a soft brush.
</p>


<h4><a name="photo">Photographic Materials</a>
</h4>
<p>These come in two broad categories each requiring different environmental conditions:</p>
<h5>Photographic Prints</h5>

<p>These consists of two parts: an image layer and a support layer. The support layer is usually composed of paper though it may be made of glass, metal or other materials
</p>
<p>• The image layer is composed of a number of chemicals and the more chemicals the more complex the photograph.
</p>
<p>•	Black and white photographic images consist of silver, embedded in a gelatin, albumen or collodion binder (emulsion layer)
 </p>
<p>• Colour images are composed of a number of organic dyes embedded in three layers of gelatin.
</p>
<p>• Black and white photographs are fairly stable to light whereas colour images are sensitive to light, can fade in dark and easily affected by temperature and RH
</p>
<p>Photographic prints are best kept at temperatures below 20 degrees Celcius and the following RH levels:
</p>
<p>• 30 – 35% for black and white
</p>
<p>• 25 -30 % for colour
</p>
<p>• 20 – 30 % for materials in cold storage
</p>
<p>• Photographic materials should be stored in total darkness and exposure to light should be at the lowest intensity possible (50lux)
</p>
<p>• Handling should be with gloves at all times.
</p>
<p>• They should not be bend or folded and paper clips, staples or other attachments should not be used
</p>
<p>• Storage areas should be free of dust and any cleaning materials that might give off polluting chemical fumes or acids. Ideally they should be stored in individual enclosures to shield them from dust, dirt, handling and the environment.
</p>
<h4><a name="nega">Photographic Negatives, Slides and Transparencies</a></h4>

<p>• Like prints these also is composed of an image layer and support layer.
</p>
<p>• The support is generally made of polyester, cellulose acetate or cellulose nitrate film.
</p>
<p>• The image layer of a black and white negative is usually composed of silver particles embedded in gelatin. 
</p>
<p>• The image layer of colour negatives also contains silver particles which are bleached during development action which affects the stability of colour negatives.
</p>
<p>• Slides are similar to negatives but are positive imges whose colours are formed from organic dyes
</p>
<p>• Photographic negatives are best kept at temperatures below 20 degrees Celcious and RH indicated below:
</p>
<p>• 30 – 35%vfor films and slides
</p>
<p>• 25 – 30 % for glass plate negatives and glass slides
</p>

<h4><a name="magnetic">Magnetic and electronic media</a>
</h4>
<p>• They should be stored in their original containers as long as they are clean and can retard fire.
</p>
<p>• They should be protected from direct light and dust
</p>
<p>• Temperatures should be kept at 18 – 20 degrees Celcious and RH between 40 and 50%
</p>
<p>• Fluctuations of Temp and RH should be avoided by all means.
</p>
<p>• Ideally they should be handled with clean cotton cloves.
</p>
<p>• All storage areas should be kept free of dust as much as is possible
</p>
