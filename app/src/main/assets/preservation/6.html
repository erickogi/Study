<h2>Planning for a preservation management programme</h2>
 <h4>Preservation survey – Institutional level
</h4>
<p>A sound preservation programme must be based on a thorough understanding of the physical plant and environment; the range, formats and conditions of the collection, policies and the institutional organization structure.
</p>
<p>As a result of such a survey, a needs assessment statement can be written and used to design a preservation program that is developed incrementally over time.</p>


<h4>Preservation survey – collection level
</h4>
<p>Following a review of repository-wide conditions and policies, attention should be directed towards the need of individual collections, especially for improved housing and reformatting or repository
</p>
<p>To do this, one can integrate data gathering with on-going information centre functions by for instance having survey forms filled whenever problems are noted during accessioning or processing activities or before reshelving after every use ; alternatively, a special project could be undertaken to collect the data.
 </p>
<p>The data collected serves as a framework for long range preservation planning 
</p>

<h4>Establishing preservation priorities
</h4>
<p>Data gathered on the physical needs collection must be considered in combination with available resources and the relative values and projected uses of the materials as the basis for assigning preservation priorities
 </p>
<p>Information materials may be regarded from a number of perspectives and values attached accordingly. In part, the assignment of values will determine which information materials must be maintained in the original format, and which  ones must be copied or reformatted to preserve their informational content
</p>
<h4>Preservation decision making
</h4>
<p>Once you know where you are, it is possible to decide where you wish to go and how to get there as expeditiously as possible.
 </p>
<p>B4 preservation decision making, infor. must be gathered, organized, and analyzed on the preservation needs of the holdings and the relative values of the collections
 </p>
<p>All these must be balanced against financial and staff resources and available technical expertise
</p>
<p>Preservation decision making at the collection level involves deciding among collections (which one presents the greatest priority for attention) as well as deciding what the appropriate actions are for a given collection 
 </p>
<p>Decisions made among collections take into consideration relative importance and value on the one hand and the degree of need on the other
 </p>
 
 
 <h4>Preservation budget</h4>

<p>The amount of money that should be budgeted for preservation activities will depend on the size and needs of the collection; the number of discrete program areas and the number of staff members with sole or partial preservation responsibility. Supplies, equipment and services also must figure into the equation.

</p>
<p>• Funds budgeted for preservation should grow incrementally on an annual basis to reflect and support program development and expansion until a mature program is achieved at which point major budget growth would level off
</p>
<p>• The preservation programme must receive consistent, ongoing institutional support if it is to make any process
