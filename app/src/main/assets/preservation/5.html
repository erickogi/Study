<h3>Digitization</h3>
<p>It is the transfer of information from paper system to electronic format.  
</p>

<h4>Benefits of Digitization as a Preservation Reformatting Option
</h4>
<p>•	Benefits of using digitization as a reformatting method for paper-based materials include:
 </p>
<p>• Increased accessibility
</p>
<p>• Increased functionality
</p>
<p>Users can simultaneously compare selected digital page images of originals</p>
<p>digital images can be converted to searchable text files to enable searching and analysis of   content within and across works, independent of location
</p>
<p>digital copies can be manipulated (enlarged and contrast changed) to support some types of art factual study
</p>
<p>users can have cut and paste options for ease of citation, etc.</p>
<p>Output capability to other media
</p>
<p>• can create printed facsimiles in accordance with   preservation specifications to meet user needs
</p>
<p>• can generate computer output microfilm that meets preservation specifications</p>
<p>• can generate multiple digital copies without loss of quality
</p>
<p>Systematic and purposeful collaboration
 </p>
<p>• once one institution has digitized a collection/work, multiple institutions can easily access it and integrate into their own virtual collections, subject to relevant copyright restrictions</p>
<p>• Digital reformatting has the ability to capture and display a broad array of materials with features and characteristics that are not easily reformatted using other technologies (e.g.,color items, oversize materials and other complex graphic materials)
</p>
<p>• Digitization can address the conversion needs of other types of media beyond paper-based Printed materials (e.g., audio, film, video) and can allow collections containing a wide variety of formats to be presented and seamlessly accessed from a single interface
</p>
<h4>Issues of concern</h4>
<p>While electronic images take up less space their long term stability is not guaranteed. As a result, many professional conservators do not recommend digitization as a long term preservation mechanism.
 </p>
<p>Digitization is an expensive process because not only are there costs associated with the purchase and use of equipment but there are other hidden costs e.g. the need to review, preview and edit all digitized items to ensure accuracy.
 </p>
<p>All digitized materials are not yet acceptable in courts of law and need to retain the original in paper formats.  This puts into question the purpose of digitization.
</p>
<p>Technological obsolescence - This relates to whether the technology to read digitized materials will be available in years to come.
</p>
<p>Digital technology in relatively young as compared to other media e.g. paper and micrographic.  There is therefore a general lack of confidence in its use.
</p>

<h4>Summary
</h4>
<p>The debate on the use of digitization as a preservation strategy is growing in popularity in the archival community because digitization seems to offer excellent prospects for significant benefits for both the archives and archives users; but it also raises considerable preservation problems.
