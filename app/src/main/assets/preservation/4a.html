<h3>Microfilming</h3>

<p><b><a name="microfilming">Microfilming</a></b> – This is the photographic process of creating miniaturized images of information on high-resolution film.
</p>
<p>Microfilming concentrates information into a compact and relatively easy-to-use form so that so much information may be stored in a small space and read using microfilm or microfiche readers
 </p>
 
 <h3>Benefits of microfilming</h3>
<p>• It dramatically reduces the space required for keeping large collections of information;
</p>
<p>• Although it is expensive to produce initially, microfilming is relatively low cost to duplicate and ship, making an ideal medium for publishing textual research materials;
</p>
<p>• A properly produced microfilm copy is recognized legally as an acceptable substitute for originals;
</p>
<p>• Providing multiple copies of records within or outside the repository without damaging or risking originals;
</p>
<p>• Preserving the original order of records preventing disorder or loss of information;
</p>
<p>• Ensuring the safe preservation of information through the provision of security copies of documents;
</p>
<p>• Protecting original copies by providing copies for research use
</p>
<p>• Saving money, particularly in an office environment through reductions on storage space, increase in speed of retrieval and improved security.
</p>


<h4>Drawbacks of microfilm application
</h4>
<p>• Since it is a black and white medium, it is difficult to copy color originals effectively;
</p>
<p>• Poorly organized records will be more difficult to use on microfilm, as disorganized information is more difficult to retrieve;
</p>
<p>• Microfilming is costly and so if poorly planned can be a heavy expense without adequate benefits;
</p>
<p>• In some countries it may not be admissible in courts of law;
</p>
<p>• The preservation of microfilm requires good quality environmental conditions which can be difficult to achieve;
</p>
<p>• It requires high technical stds if these are not achieved the benefits of microfilming are outweighed by the drawbacks of poorly produced or rapidly deteriorating films
</p>
<p>• It requires readers or printers for both staff anf public use;
</p>
<p>• May cause eyestrains and fatique.
</p>
<p>Microfilming can therefore be applied for the following purposes:
</p>
<p><b>Security copying</b>
</p>
<p>Archival institutions make copies of documents in their custody in order to have a substitute if the original is destroyed through a disaster or some other cause of deterioration. Security copies should never be used except where no substitute is available. The requirements of a security copy include 
 </p>
<p>Durability should be more than 100 years
</p>
<p>Should be capable of being copied with little loss of quality• </p>
<p>Should be kept in a different location
</p>
<p>Should reproduce all written information of the original document
</p>

<h4>Preservation copying
</h4>
<p>This is done in order to avail to researchers copies of original materials. The preservation principle is normally tied to the security principle. However, there are cases which might warrant the use of original material by researchers e.g. where a researcher is carrying out a specialized study , If the existing archival legislation specify the use of original material and if a researcher has eye sight problems
 </p>
 
 <h4>Acquisition copying
</h4>
<p>• This is done for various reasons
</p>
<p>• To have copies of collections which are preserved elsewhere.
</p>
<p>• To complete collections of an infor. centre with related materials and by means of this increase the information value of its holding.
</p>
<p>• To make up documents which are missing from an information collection i.e filling up the gaps due to disasters, transfer etc.
</p>
<p>• To establish a new collection on setting selected topics relating to an historical era, group or territory
</p>
<p>• To remedy or settle temporary an archival claim where two or more countries claim for themselves the same materials.
</p>

<h4>Disposal copying
</h4>
<p>Institution may choose to make copies of original document and retain the copies while destroying originals which release expensive storage space.  This is true in regard to newspapers which present storage problems due to their numbers, size and quality of paper in which they are printed.  However copying followed by destruction is generally not acceptedin most archival institutions.  An institution therefore needs to consider the cost of disposal copying verses construction of more storage areas/rooms.
</p>
<h4>Publication Copying
</h4>





<p>• This enables archival institutions to make copies of records, finding aids, preserved in order to publicize them to the interested users because of various reasons;
</p>
<p>• The growing information demand of researches.
</p>
<p>• The high cost of printing
</p>
<p>• The increasing role of archives in public life.
