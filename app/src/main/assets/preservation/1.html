   	<h3>Overview of preservation management</h3>
<p>•	Information professionals esp. record keeping professionals have long realized the importance of preservation of information materials by acknowledging that such materials in their custody require safe keeping.</p>
<p>•	Sir Hillary Jenkinson  for instance stated that archivists / records managers have a responsibility towards both moral and physical defence of archives/records
</p>
<p>••••	Moral defence refers to the intellectual processes undertaken to ensure sound records/archives mgt.
</p>
<p>••••	Physical defence refers to the physical care and security required to ensure that the materials are preserved.
</p>

<p><b>•	Although deterioration of infor. Materials has been recognized as a problem for many centuries, the problem is more acute today due to a combination of factors:</b>
</p>
<p><i>  •proliferation and use of brittle paper in most offices and organizations today including recycled paper
</i></p>
<p><i>  •The dramatic increasing use of new technologies and the prevalence of electronic information materials in most organizations (has created a whole new range of preservation concerns and challenges
</i></p>
<p>This has no doubt increased the vulnerability of information resources and at the same time accelerated the need to deal with the various preservation challenges which they pose.
</p>
<p>•	Preservation is therefore one of several underlying concepts that are generally included in mission and goals statements of information centres
</p>
<p>• To many preservation is the very cornerstone upon which information centres especially so archival institutions are founded.
</p>
<p>• While preservation is a primary goal or responsibility of information centres, an equally 
</p>
<p>• Compelling mandate – access and use- sets up a classic conflict that must be arbitrated by the custodians and caretakers of information materials 
</p>
<p>• The dual responsibilities of preserving and making materials available for use require that information centres/ archival institutions  balance sometimes conflicting needs, set priorities and allocate scarce resources judiciously when managing information centre programs.
</p>
 <h4>Definition of Terms</h4>
<p><strong>Preservation- </strong>has been defined by different scholars and professionals in different ways </p>
<p><strong>• Millar & Roper (1999) </strong>operations involved in the protection of information materials against damage or deterioration.
 </p>
<p>•<strong>O’Toole (1989)- </strong>defines it as the processes geared to providing a level of environmental control, housing, care and maintenance that will retard further chemical deterioration and protect materials from physical damage
 </p>
<p>• <strong>ICA (1989)-</strong>defines it as a basic archival function of storing and protecting records and archives/information materials for the purpose of ensuring their continued stability, availability, retrievability and usability.
</p>
<p>• <strong>Ritzenthaler (1993)- </strong>sharing the above view describes preservation as a basic function and integral component of archives management. She further describes preservation as consisting of a wide variety of interrelated activities designed to prolong the usable life of information materials
 </p>
<p>From all the above definitions, preservation encompasses the following:
</p>
<p>-Activities that prolong the usable life of information materials;
</p>
<p>-Activities designed to minimize the loss of information content (intellectual) of information materials;
 </p>
<p>-Activities concerned with the remedial treatment of damaged information materials with the aim of returning them as near as possible to their original state;
</p>
<p>-Activities concerned with the remedial treatment of damaged information materials with the aim of returning them as near as possible to their original state;
 </p>
<p><strong>Digital Preservation – Pujar (2008) -</strong>defines digital preservation as a process of maintaining, in a condition suitable for use, materials produced in digital formats including the preservation of bit stream and the continued ability to render or display the content represented by the bit stream
 </p>
<p><strong>Conservation- Patkus (2003)</strong> defines conservation as the reactive treatment of information materials in order to strengthen them physically or stabilize them chemically thus sustaining their survival as long as possible in their original form
</p>
<p><strong>Ritzenthaler - </strong>observes that conservation is generally considered to be one aspect of an overall preservation program that aims to stabilize information materials in their original format by chemical and physical means.
 </p>
<p>Conservation is therefore carried out for the following purposes:
</p>
<p>- To return deteriorated items to stable and usable condition;
 </p>
<p>- To render information materials capable of being safely duplicated
</p>
<p><strong>Deterioration </strong>– a gradual process of physical or chemical change or damage to information materials that if left unchecked could turn catastrophic.
 </p>
<p><strong>Examination </strong>- This is a preliminary diagnostic process that is undertaken before any repair or recovery is done on information materials. It involves a thorough inspection of affected information materials to determine </p>
<p>• Extent of damage to information materials
</p>
<p>• Type of information material and materials from which it is made from</p>
<p>• Physical and chemical stability of the information materials and whether it can withstand repair or any form of treatment
</p>
<p>• Type of treatment and/or repair appropriate for the type of the material and recovery process
</p>


<h4>Maintenance and Good Housekeeping</h4>
<p>Maintenance refers to the day to day care of information materials in a secure and controlled environment.
</p>
<p>The key to maintenance is good housekeeping. This demands that information materials are maintained in a clean, healthy, dust-free, pollution-free environment and in storage conditions free of biological pests. It also demands that information materials are handled with care to prevent any form of damage.

</p>
<p><strong>Lignin –</strong> An acidic substance that is a natural product of all wooded plants. It is non-carbohydrate, non-fibrous substance in the cell walls of living plants that is responsible for their strength and rigidity but that in paper contributes to its degradation
 </p>
<p><strong>Acidity</strong> – This refers to the amount of acid concentration in any given product. Acids contain high levels of positively charged hydrogen ions which are the cause of damage to paper products
