possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--<b>Intelligence </b>– a manager tries to discover, identify, and
understand the problems occurring in the organization – why is there a problem
and what effects is it having on the firm? One recognizes that a decision is
necessary; that it must be made. Your awareness may be triggered by a variety
of things: the need to change business focus, pressure from employees or
customers, etc. You then try to define clearly the nature of the decision you
must make. You must define and clarify the issue: does it warrant action? If
so, now or later? Etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--<b>Design</b>. Involves identifying and exploring various solutions
to problems by:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>Gathering relevant information - know what information is needed
information, and how to get it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>-- <b>Identify alternatives</b> - through the information collected, or
by using your imagination and information collected, or you may brainstorm
within the organization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>– <b>Weigh evidence</b> - evaluate whether the problem identified in
Step 1 will be solved through the use of each alternative. i.e., consider and
compare the pros and cons of each option. Then place the available alternatives
in priority order, based upon some value system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:Ebrima'>Choice </span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
107%;font-family:Ebrima'>- select a course of action from those available,
which seems to be best suited to solve the problem. You may even choose a
combination of alternatives. Avoid vagueness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:Ebrima'>Implementation</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:Ebrima'> - implement the alternative you chose.
Inform all those who may be involved and affected, and follow up to ensure
proper and effective implementation. Also evaluate whether or not the decision
chosen has solved the problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:Ebrima'>Types of Decisions</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Decisions are categorized as structured (or programmed),
semi-structured (or semi-programmed) and unstructured (or non-programmed).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Unstructured decisions are those in which the decision-maker must use
their own best judgment, evaluation, and insight to solve the problem. Such
decisions are non-routine. They are characterized by a high degree of
uncertainty and cannot be delegated to lower level management, e.g. approving
capital budget; launching new products, etc. Answering these questions require
access to internal and external sources of information</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Structured decisions are repetitive and routine, and involve a
definite procedure for handling them so that they don’t have to be treated each
time as if they were new. They are also often automated, e.g. and include
determining special offers to customers, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Semi-structured decisions. These are decisions that have elements of
both structured and unstructured decisions. Only part of the problem has
clear-cut answer provided by an accepted procedure. E.g. preparing a departmental
budget, or a corporate website, tactical managers will need to get reports and
information from the firm’s information system (structured) as well as
interview staff and customers (unstructured).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--The different management levels in an organization have different
information requirements for decision support and responsibility for different
types of decisions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>– At strategic level, information is largely external-oriented but may
also be internal-oriented, depending on the decision to be made</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>– At middle level, information is both internal and external-oriented</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>– At operational level, information is largely internal-oriented</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:

decision-making.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Decision-making is based on information. Information is the trigger
to knowing there is a problem. Information is needed to define and structure
the problem, to explore and choose between alternative solutions, and to review
the effects of the implemented choice</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'> --Examples of how various MISs support the different levels of
management to make different types of decisions:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--MIS provide routine reports and summaries of transaction-level data
to middle level managers to provide answers to structured and semi-structured
decision-problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--DSS provide analytical models or tools for analyzing large quantities
of data and supportive interactive queries for middle managers who face
semi-structured decision situations and senior managers who make unstructured
decisions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--ESS provide senior management with external information and
high-level summaries of the firm’s performance, to make primarily unstructured
decisions</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--KWS provide tools for knowledge discovery, communication, and
collaboration that make knowledge more easily available to decision makers and
integrate it into the business processes of the firm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:

decisions. Some of the models are at the individual level of analysis and some
are at the organizational level. Exploring both levels of analysis can be
useful in building effective computerized MIS.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>Common categories of decision making models are explained below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'> (i) <b>Prescriptive (or normative or rational </b>model)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--is one which automatically selects the best option.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Usually developed by operational researchers, economists and
management scientists.--It is well-defined and structured and treats decision
making as an entirely rational process</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--It is grounded on goals/objectives, alternatives, consequences and
optimality</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--It assumes that complete information regarding the decision to be
made is available and one correct conception of a problem or decision to be
made can be determined</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--It assumes also that the decision-makers consistently assess the
advantages and disadvantages of any alternatives with goals and objectives in
mind and then evaluate the consequences of selecting or not selecting each
alternative. The best alternative is then selected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--It more suited to operational and tactical levels where there is less
uncertainty</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:Ebrima'>Major advantage.</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:Ebrima'> The model utilizes a logical, sequential
approach. Decisions are made by determining the objectives to be obtained,
evaluating the potential alternatives and choosing the “best” alternative.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:Ebrima'>Major disadvantage.</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:Ebrima'> It assumes (quite wrongly!) that there
are no biases to the decision-making process</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>(ii)<b><i>Descriptive decision model</i></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--have been developed by behavioral scientists and seek to explain
actual behaviour in decision-making.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Actual decision-making is less structured and is not completely
rational</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Decision makers take account of imperfections of knowledge and
behaviour and, because of practical difficulties, are prepared to accept a
solution as ‘satisfactory’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Decision-makers are not fully aware of all the alternatives available
nor is there a single, clear-cut objective. Decision-making is rational but
within boundaries of imperfections of information (i.e., bounded rationality)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--This means that formal MIS should provide decision-makers with
background information and ways of exploring alternatives rather than
mechanical decision rules and procedures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--It is very appropriate at top-level management</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>(iii)<b>The Process model</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--It is fairly structured. Decisions are made based upon standard
operating procedures within the organization. Actions and behaviors occur in
accordance with these procedures or guidelines</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Conformity is an integral part of the process model since it is the
means by which doubt is dealt with during the decision task. If decision makers
are uncertain as to the potential effectiveness or the results of a decision,
they conform to the pre-established standard</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'> --Conformity is both an advantage and a disadvantage, e.g. if
uncertain about what to do, follow established procedure. On the other hand, it
is bureaucratic – following standard operating procedures can be very lengthy
and so delays decision-making.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>(iv)<b>The Garbage Can Model</b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--This model is useful where the involvement of participants fluctuates
in the amount of time and effort given, and choices are inconsistent and not
well defined</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--Here, an opportunity to make a decision is described as a garbage can
into which many types of problems and solutions are dropped independently of
each other by decision-makers as these problems and solutions are generated</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>--The problems, solutions and decision makers are not necessarily
related to each other. They move from one decision opportunity to another in
such a manner that the solutions, the time needed and the problems seem to rely
on a chance alignment of components to complete the decision.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:Ebrima'>Advantage</span></u></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:Ebrima'>. The model provides a real-world
representation of the non-rational manner in which decisions are often made
within an organization. Not all decisions are made in a logical or standard
fashion. Occasionally, decisions are made on an ad hoc basis when the
solutions, problems and individuals involved in the task happen to align.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:Ebrima'>Disadvantage</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:Ebrima'>. It is not efficient means of making a
decision</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
Ebrima'>– choices are made only when the combination of problems, solutions and
individuals allow the decision to happen (i.e., are in alignment). Also, it is
accidental decision making.</span></p>
