<h3>Estimation Issues</h3>
<p>Often, project managers resort to estimating schedules skipping to estimate size.<br/> This may be because of the timelines set by the top management or the marketing team. <br/>However, whatever the reason, if this is done, then at a later stage it would be difficult to estimate the schedules to accommodate the scope changes.</p>
<p>While estimating, certain assumptions may be made. It is important to note all these assumptions in the estimation sheet, as some still do not document assumptions in estimation sheets.</p>
<p>Even good estimates have inherent assumptions, risks, and uncertainty, and yet they are often treated as though they are accurate.</p>
<p>The best way of expressing estimates is as a range of possible outcomes by saying, for example, that the project will take 5 to 7 months instead of stating it will be complete on a particular date or it will be complete in a fixed no. of months. Beware of committing to a range that is too narrow as that is equivalent to committing to a definite date.</p>
<p>•	You could also include uncertainty as an accompanying probability value. <br/>For example, there is a 90% probability that the project will complete on or before a definite date.</p>
<p>•	Organizations do not collect accurate project data. Since the accuracy of the estimates depend on the historical data, it would be an issue.</p>
<p>•	For any project, there is a shortest possible schedule that will allow you to include the required functionality and produce quality output. If there is a schedule constraint by management and/or client, you could negotiate on the scope and functionality to be delivered.</p>
<p>•	Agree with the client on handling scope creeps to avoid schedule overruns.</p>
<p>•	Failure in accommodating contingency in the final estimate causes issues. For e.g., meetings, organizational events.</p>
<p>•	Resource utilization should be considered as less than 80%.<br/> This is because the resources would be productive only for 80% of their time. If you assign resources at more than 80% utilization, there is bound to be slippages.</p>
