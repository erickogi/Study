   	<h3>Design Process</h3>
<p>Software design process can be perceived as series of well-defined steps.</p>
<p> Though it varies according to design approach (function oriented or object oriented, yet It may have the following steps involved:</p>
<p>•	A solution design is created from requirement or previous used system and/or system sequence diagram.</p>
<p>•	Objects are identified and grouped into classes on behalf of similarity in attribute characteristics.</p>
<p>•	Class hierarchy and relation among them is defined.</p>
<p>•	Application framework is defined.</p>

<h3>Software Design Approaches</h3>
<p>Here are two generic approaches for software designing:</p>

<h4>Top Down Design</h4>
<p>We know that a system is composed of more than one sub-systems and it contains a number of components. </p>
<p>Further, these sub-systems and components may have their on set of sub-system and components and creates hierarchical structure in the system.</p>
<p>Top-down design takes the whole software system as one entity and then decomposes it to achieve more than one sub-system or component based on some characteristics.</p>
<p> Each sub-system or component is then treated as a system and decomposed further. This process keeps on running until the lowest level of system in the top-down hierarchy is achieved.</p>
<p>Top-down design starts with a generalized model of system and keeps on defining the more specific part of it. When all components are composed the whole system comes into existence.</p>
<p>Top-down design is more suitable when the software solution needs to be designed from scratch and specific details are unknown.</p>

<h4>Bottom-up Design</h4>
<p>The bottom up design model starts with most specific and basic components. It proceeds with composing higher level of components by using basic or lower level components.</p>
<p> It keeps creating higher level components until the desired system is not evolved as one single component. With each higher level, the amount of abstraction is increased.</p>
<P>Bottom-up strategy is more suitable when a system needs to be created from some existing system, where the basic primitives can be used in the newer system.</p>
<p>Both, top-down and bottom-up approaches are not practical individually. Instead, a good combination of both is used.</p>
