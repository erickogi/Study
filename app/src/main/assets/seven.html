<h1>LECTURE 7 - SOFTWARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT</h1>

<h2>What is Management?</h2>
<p>The creation and maintenance of an internal environment in an enterprise where individuals, working together in groups, can perform efficiently and effectively toward the attainment of group goals.</p>
<p>A project is well-defined task, which is a collection of several operations done in order to achieve a goal (for example, software development and delivery).</p> 
<p>A Project can be characterized as:</p>
<p>•	Every project may has a unique and distinct goal.</p>
<p>•	Project is not routine activity or day-to-day operations.</p>
<[>•	Project comes with a start time and end time.</p>
<p>•	Project ends when its goal is achieved hence it is a temporary phase in the lifetime of an organization.</p>
<p>•	Project needs adequate resources in terms of time, manpower, finance, material and knowledge-bank.</p>
<br/>
<p>A Software Project is the complete procedure of software development from requirement gathering to testing and maintenance, carried out according to the execution methodologies, in a specified period of time to achieve intended software product.</p>

<h4>Why Software Project Management?</h4>
<p>•	Professional SE is always subject to organizational budget and schedule constraints.</p>
<p>•	SPM’s job is to ensure that s/w projects meet these constraints and delivers s/w that contributes to the goals of the organization developing the s/w.</p>
<p>•	SE different from other engineering:</p>
<p>•	Product is intangible:  rely on others to produce the documentation needed too review progress.</p>
<p>•	No standard s/w processes: vary dramatically from one organization to another.</p>
<p>•	Large s/w projects are often one-off projects (cannot anticipate problems, rapid technological changes in ICT, each project different from other.</p>

<h4>Responsibilities that a project manager shoulders -
Managing People</h4>
<p>•	Act as project leader</p>
<p>•	Liaison with stakeholders</p>
<p>•	Managing human resources</p>
<p>•	Setting up reporting hierarchy etc.</p>
<h4>Managing Project</h4>
<p>•	Defining and setting up project scope</p>
<p>•	Managing project management activities</p>
<p>•	Monitoring progress and performance</p>
<p>•	Risk analysis at every phase</p>
<p>•	Take necessary step to avoid or come out of problems</p>
<p>•	Act as project spokesperson</p>

<h4>Management Activities</h4>
<p>SE jobs varies tremendously depending on the organization and the s/w product being developed. Activities</p>
<p>1	Proposal writing</p>
<p>2	Project planning and scheduling</p>
<p>3	Project cost</p>
<p>4	Project monitoring and reviews</p>
<p>5	Personnel selection and evaluation</p>
<p>6	Report writing and presentations</p>
<p>7	Project Managers select people to work on project. WHO?</p>
<p>8	Most cases, managers have to settle for a less-than-ideal project team. WHY?</p>

<h4>Management Tasks</h4>
<p>1	Planning</p>
<p>2	Organizing</p>
<p>3	Staffing</p>
<p>4	Directing</p>
<p>5	Controlling</p>
<p>6	Managers also deal with deviations from the plan.</p>

<p><i>NB: PLAN THE WORK AND WORK THE  PLAN</i></p>

<h3>PROJECT PLANNING</h3>
<p>1	Effective management of software project depends on thoroughly planning the progress of the project.</p>
<p>2	SPM’s draw a plan to be used as the driver for the project - organizational goals a must</p>
<p>3	Planning an iterative process – only complete when the project itself is complete.</p>
<p>4	Assess the constraints affecting the project (required delivery date, staff available, overall budget, etc).</p>
<p>5	Estimate project parameters (structure, size, distribution of functions).</p>
<p>6	Define progress milestones and deliverables.</p>
<p>7	Schedule Project Technical Review – renegotiate milestones and constraints.</p>

<h4>Milestones vs. Deliverables<h4>
<p>Milestones:  A predictable outcome of an activity where some formal report of progress should be presented to management.</p>
<p>Deliverables: is a project result that is delivered to the customer.<br/> Delivered at the end of some major project phase eg. specification or design. Deliverables are usually milestones, but milestones need not be deliverables.</p>

<h3>Software Productivity</h3>
<p>.	How can we define/measure the productivity of s/w? - In terms of lines of code produced.</p>
<p>.	But what do engineers do? up to half their time spent in meetings, administrative matters, communication with team members. </p>

<h4>Factors affecting productivity</h4>
<p>1	Professionals' capabilities</p>
<p>2	Product complexity</p>
<p>3	Schedule constraints</p>
<p>4	Previous experience</p>
	
 <h3>Project Cost - Cost Estimation</h3>
<P>Software Engineers need predictive methods to estimate the complexity of software before it has been developed.</p>
<p>.	predict size of the software</p>
<p>Project Estimation</p>
<p>For an effective management accurate estimation of various measures is a must. With correct estimation managers can manage and control the project more efficiently and effectively. 
Project estimation may involve the following:</p>
<h4>•	Software size estimation </h4>
<p>Software size may be estimated either in terms of KLOC (Kilo Line of Code) or by calculating number of function points in the software.<br/> Lines of code depend upon coding practices and Function points vary according to the user or software requirement.</p>
<h4>•	Effort estimation</h4> 
<p>The managers estimate efforts in terms of personnel requirement and man-hour required to produce the software. For effort estimation software size should be known.<br/> This can either be derived by managers’ experience, organization’s historical data or software size can be converted into efforts by using some standard formulae. </p>
<h4>•	Time estimation </h4>
<p>Once size and efforts are estimated, the time required to produce the software can be estimated.</p>
<p> Efforts required is segregated into sub categories as per the requirement specifications and interdependency of various components of software.<br/> Software tasks are divided into smaller tasks, activities or events by Work Breakthrough Structure (WBS). The tasks are scheduled on day-to-day basis or in calendar months.</p>
<p>The sum of time required to complete all tasks in hours or days is the total time invested to complete the project.</p>
<h4>•	Cost estimation </h4>
<p>This might be considered as the most difficult of all because it depends on more elements than any of the previous ones. For estimating project cost, it is required to consider -</p> 
<p>o	Size of software</p>
<p>o	Software quality</p>
<p>o	Hardware</p>
<p>o	Additional software or tools, licenses etc.</p>
<p>o	Skilled personnel with task-specific skills</p>
<p>o	Travel involved</p>
<p>o	Communication</p>
<p>o	Training and support</p>

<h3>Project Estimation Techniques</h3>
<p>We discussed various parameters involving project estimation such as size, effort, time and cost.
Project manager can estimate the listed factors using two broadly recognized techniques –</p>

<h4>Decomposition Technique</h4>
<p>This technique assumes the software as a product of various compositions.</p>
<p>There are two main models -</p><br/>
<p>•	Line of Code Estimation is done on behalf of number of line of codes in the software product.</p>
<p>•	Function Points Estimation is done on behalf of number of function points in the software product.</p>

<h4>Empirical Estimation Technique</h4>
<p>This technique uses empirically derived formulae to make estimation.These formulae are based on LOC or FPs.</p>
<br/>
<h5>•	Putnam Model </h5>
<p>This model is made by Lawrence H. Putnam, which is based on Norden’s frequency distribution (Rayleigh curve). Putnam model maps time and efforts required with software size.</p> 
<h5>•	COCOMO </h5>
<p>COCOMO stands for COnstructive COst MOdel, developed by Barry W. Boehm. It divides the software product into three categories of software: organic, semi-detached and embedded.</p>

<h4>Typical cost driver categories</h4>
<p>1	Product e.g., reliability requirements or inherent complexity</p>
<p>2	Computer e.g., are there execution time or storage constraints?</p>
<p>3	Personnel e.g., are the personnel experienced in the application area or the programming language being used?</p>
<p>4	Project e.g., are sophisticated software tools being used?</p>

<h3>Management Challenges</h3>
<p>1	Deliver a high-quality software (product) with limited resources.</p>
<p>2	Balance conflicting goals.</p>
<p>3	Organize an activity that is fundamentally intellectual.</p>
<p>4	this complicates the traditional techniques for productivity measurement, project planning, cost and schedule estimation. </p>

<h3>People and Productivity</h3>
<p>1	Because software engineering is predominantly an intellectual activity, the most important ingredient for producing high-quality software efficiently is people.</p> 
<p>2	So there is a large variability in productivity between engineers. </p>
<p>3	SPMs are responsible for planning and scheduling project development.</p>
<p>4	Supervise the work to ensure that it is carried out to the required standards, monitor progress to check that the development is on time and within budget.</p>

<h3>WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES OF A GOOD PROJECT MANAGER?</h3>

<h4>1. Command authority naturally.</h4>
<p>In other words, they don’t need borrowed power to enlist the help of others – they just know how to do it.<br/> They are optimistic leaders who are viewed in a favorable light and are valued by the organization.</p>
<h4>2. Possess quick sifting abilities, knowing what to note and what to ignore.</h4>
<p>The latter is more important since there’s almost always too much data, and rarely too little. Ignoring the right things is better than trying to master extraneous data.</p>
<h4>3. Set, observe, and re-evaluate project priorities frequently.</h4>
<p>They focus and prioritize by handling fewer emails, attending fewer meetings, and generally limiting their data input.</p>
<h4>4. Ask good questions and listen to stakeholders.</h4>
<p>Great project managers don’t just go through the motions. They care about communication and the opinions of the parties involved. <br/>They are also sufficiently self-aware to know how their communication is received by those stakeholders.</p>
<h4>5. Do not use information as a weapon or a means of control.</h4>
<p>They communicate clearly, completely, and concisely. All the while giving others real information without fear of what they’ll do with it.</p>
<h4>6. Adhere to predictable communication schedules</h4>
<p>…recognizing that it’s the only deliverable early in a project cycle. All this takes place after very thorough pre-execution planning to eliminate as many variables as possible.</p>
<h4>7. Possess domain expertise in project management as applied to a particular field.</h4>
<p>It’s not just that they have generic project management skills; they have a deep familiarity with one or multiple fields that gives them a natural authority and solid strategic insight.</p>
<h4>8. Exercise independent and fair consensus-building skills when conflict arises.</h4>
<p>But they embrace only as much conflict as is absolutely necessary, neither avoiding nor seeking grounds for control of a particular project segment.</p>
<h4>9. Cultivate and rely on extensive informal networks inside and outside the firm to solve problems that arise.</h4>
<p>They identify any critical issues that threaten projects and handle them resolutely (vs. ignoring them).</p>
<h4>10. Look forward to going to work!</h4>
<p>They believe that project management is an exciting challenge that’s critical to success. The truly great ones view project management as a career and not a job, and they treat it like so by seeking additional training and education.</p>

<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>1	An organization structure is used to structure the communication patterns among members of a team</p>
<p>2	Traditional team organization is hierarchical with a manager supervising a group or groups of groups</p>
<p>3	Other organizations have been tried in software engineering with some success
</p>
<h4>Chief-programmer teams</h4>
<p>1	A way to centralize the control of a software development team </p>
<p>2	chief programmer (CP) responsible for design + reports to peer manager responsible for administration </p>
<p>3	other members are a software librarian and programmers </p>
<p>4	report to C and are added to team when needed</p> 
<p>5	Best when the solution may be understood and controlled by one chief architect</p>
<h3>Team structure</h3>
  <div class="erb-image-wrapper">
<img src="file:///android_asset/team.png" alt="histogram" />
</div>
<h4>Decentralized team organization</h4>
<p>1	Decisions are made by consensus, and all work is considered group work.</p>
<p>2	Members review each other’s work and are responsible as a group for what every member produces.   </p>
 <div class="erb-image-wrapper">
<img src="file:///android_asset/decentralized.png" alt="histogram" />
</div>
<p>3	Best when the problem or solution is not well-understood and requires the contribution of several people to clarify it.</p>
 

<h4>Mixed-control team organization</h4>
<p>1	Attempts to combine the benefits of centralized and decentralized control </p>
<p>2	Differentiates engineers into senior and junior</p>
<p>3	Senior engineer leads a group of juniors and reports to a project manager</p>
<p>4	Control vested in the project manager and senior programmers</p>
<p>5	Communication is decentralized among each set of individuals, peers, and their immediate supervisors </p>

</div>
<h3>Project Scheduling/Control</h3>
<p>1	Project Scheduling in a project refers to roadmap of all activities to be done with specified order and within time slot allotted to each activity. </p>
<p>2	Project managers tend to define various tasks, and project milestones and them arrange them keeping various factors in mind. <br/>They look for tasks lie in critical path in the schedule, which are necessary to complete in specific manner (because of task interdependency) and strictly within the time allocated.<br/> Arrangement of tasks which lies out of critical path are less likely to impact over all schedule of the project.</p>
<p>3	PS involves separating the total work involved in a project into separate activities and judging the time required to complete these activities.</p>
<p>	Work Breakdown Structure describes a break down of project goal into intermediate goals.</p>
<p>	Represented as a set of charts showing the work breakdown, activities dependencies and staff allocations. </p>
<p>For scheduling a project, it is necessary to -</p>
<p>•	Break down the project tasks into smaller, manageable form </p>
<p>•	Find out various tasks and correlate them</p>
<p>•	Estimate time frame required for each task</p>
<p>•	Divide time into work-units</p>
<p>•	Assign adequate number of work-units for each task</p>
<p>•	Calculate total time required for the project from start to finish</p>
<p>	Example: Class Projects</p>

</div>

<h3>Project Management Tools</h3>
<p>The risk and uncertainty rises multifold with respect to the size of the project, even when the project is developed according to set methodologies.</p>
<p>There are tools available, which aid for effective project management. A few are described -</p>
<h4>Gantt Chart</h4>
<p>Gantt charts was devised by Henry Gantt (1917). It represents project schedule with respect to time periods.</p>
 <div class="erb-image-wrapper">
<img src="file:///android_asset/grant.png" alt="histogram" />
</div>
<p> It is a horizontal bar chart with bars representing activities and time scheduled for the project activities.</p>
 

<h4>PERT Chart</h4>
<p>PERT (Program Evaluation & Review Technique) chart is a tool that depicts project as network diagram. <br/>It is capable of graphically representing main events of project in both parallel and consecutive way. Events, which occur one after another, show dependency of the later event over the previous one.</p>
 
<p>Events are shown as numbered nodes. They are connected by labeled arrows depicting sequence of tasks in the project.</p>
   <div class="erb-image-wrapper">
<img src="file:///android_asset/pert.png" alt="histogram" />
</div>
<h4>Resource Histogram</h4>
This is a graphical tool that contains bar or chart representing number of resources (usually skilled staff) required over time for a project event (or phase). <br/>Resource Histogram is an effective tool for staff planning and coordination.</p>
    <div class="erb-image-wrapper">
<img src="file:///android_asset/histogram.png" alt="histogram" />
    <div class="erb-image-wrapper">
<img src="file:///android_asset/resourcehist.png" alt="histogram" />
</div>
<h4>Critical Path Analysis</h4>
<p>This tools is useful in recognizing interdependent tasks in the project.<br/>
 It also helps to find out the shortest path or critical path to complete the project successfully. Like PERT diagram, each event is allotted a specific time frame. </p>
 <p>This tool shows dependency of event assuming an event can proceed to next only if the previous one is completed.</p>
<p>The events are arranged according to their earliest possible start time. Path between start and end node is critical path which cannot be further reduced and all events require to be executed in same order.</p>

<h3>Project Risk Management</h4>
<p>Risk management involves all activities pertaining to identification, analyzing and making provision for predictable and non-predictable risks in the project.<br/>
 Risk may include the following:</p>
<p>•	Experienced staff leaving the project and new staff coming in.</p>
<p>•	Change in organizational management.</p>
<p>•	Requirement change or misinterpreting requirement.</p>
<p>•	Under-estimation of required time and resources.</p>
<p>•	Technological changes, environmental changes, business competition.</p>
<h3>Risk Management Process</h3>
<p>There are following activities involved in risk management process:</p>
<p>•	Identification - Make note of all possible risks, which may occur in the project.</p>
<p>•	Categorize - Categorize known risks into high, medium and low risk intensity as per their possible impact on the project.</p>
<p>•	Manage - Analyze the probability of occurrence of risks at various phases. Make plan to avoid or face risks. Attempt to minimize their side-effects.</p>
<p>•	Monitor - Closely monitor the potential risks and their early symptoms. Also monitor the effects of steps taken to mitigate or avoid them.</p>
<h3>Categories of Risks</h3>
<p>Project Risks: Affect the project schedule or resources eg. loss of an experienced designer.</p>
<p>Product Risks: Affect the quality or performance of the software being developed. Eg. failure of a purchased component to perform as expected.</p>
<p>Business Risks: Affect the organization developing or procuring the software. Eg. a competitor introducing a new product.</p>

<h3>Stages of Risk Management</h3>

<h4>Risk management process is an iterative process which continues throughout the project.</h4>
<p>1.	Risk Identification: Possible project, product and business risk identified</p>
<p>2.	Risk Analysis: The likelihood and consequences of these risks assessed, strategies identified to manage risks.</p>
<p>3.	Risk Monitoring: Plans to address the risk either by avoiding it or minimizing its effects on the project  are drawn up.</p>
<br/>
<p>o	Outcomes of risk management process are documented in a risk management plan.</p>

<h3>Project Execution & Monitoring</h3>
<p>In this phase, the tasks described in project plans are executed according to their schedules.
Execution needs monitoring in order to check whether everything is going according to the plan.</p>
<p> Monitoring is observing to check the probability of risk and taking measures to address the risk or report the status of various tasks.<br/>
These measures include -</p>
<p>•	Activity Monitoring - All activities scheduled within some task can be monitored on day-to-day basis. When all activities in a task are completed, it is considered as complete.</p>
<p>•	Status Reports - The reports contain status of activities and tasks completed within a given time frame, generally a week. Status can be marked as finished, pending or work-in-progress etc.</p>
<p>•	Milestones Checklist - Every project is divided into multiple phases where major tasks are performed (milestones) based on the phases of SDLC. This milestone checklist is prepared once every few weeks and reports the status of milestones.</p>
<h3>Project Communication Management</h3>
<p>Effective communication plays vital role in the success of a project. It bridges gaps between client and the organization, among the team members as well as other stake holders in the project such as hardware suppliers.</p>
<p>Communication can be oral or written. Communication management process may have the following <br/>steps: </p>
<p>•	Planning - <br/>This step includes the identifications of all the stakeholders in the project and the mode of communication among them. It also considers if any additional communication facilities are required.</p>
<p>•	Sharing - <br/>After determining various aspects of planning, manager focuses on sharing correct information with the correct person on correct time. This keeps every one involved the project up to date with project progress and its status.</p>
<p>•	Feedback -<br/> Project managers use various measures and feedback mechanism and create status and performance reports. <br/>This mechanism ensures that input from various stakeholders is coming to the project manager as their feedback.</p>
<p>•	Closure - <br/>At the end of each major event, end of a phase of SDLC or end of the project itself, administrative closure is formally announced to update every stakeholder by sending email, by distributing a hardcopy of document or by other mean of effective communication.</p>
<h3>Configuration Management</h3>
<p>Configuration management is a process of tracking and controlling the changes in software in terms of the requirements, design, functions and development of the product.</p>
<p>IEEE defines it as “the process of identifying and defining the items in the system, controlling the change of these items throughout their life cycle, recording and reporting the status of items and change requests, and verifying the completeness and correctness of items”.</p>
<p>Generally, once the SRS is finalized there is less chance of requirement of changes from user. If they occur, the changes are addressed only with prior approval of higher management, as there is a possibility of cost and time overrun.</p>
<h3>Baseline</h3>
<p>A phase of SDLC is assumed over if it baselined, i.e. baseline is a measurement that defines completeness of a phase.</p>
<p> A phase is baselined when all activities pertaining to it are finished and well documented. If it was not the final phase, its output would be used in next immediate phase.</p>
<p>Configuration management is a discipline of organization administration, which takes care of occurrence of any change (process, requirement, technological, strategical etc.) after a phase is baselined. CM keeps check on any changes done in software.</p>
<h3>Change Control</h3>
<p>Change control is function of configuration management, which ensures that all changes made to software system are consistent and made as per organizational rules and regulations.</p>
<p>A change in the configuration of product goes through following steps -</p>
<p>•	Identification - A change request arrives from either internal or external source. When change request is identified formally, it is properly documented.</p>
<p>•	Validation - Validity of the change request is checked and its handling procedure is confirmed.</p>
<p>•	Analysis - The impact of change request is analyzed in terms of schedule, cost and required efforts. Overall impact of the prospective change on system is analyzed.</p>
<p>•	Control - If the prospective change either impacts too many entities in the system or it is unavoidable, it is mandatory to take approval of high authorities before change is incorporated into the system. It is decided if the change is worth incorporation or not. If it is not, change request is refused formally.</p>
<p>•	Execution - If the previous phase determines to execute the change request, this phase take appropriate actions to execute the change, does a thorough revision if necessary.</p>
<p>•	Close request - The change is verified for correct implementation and merging with the rest of the system. </p>
