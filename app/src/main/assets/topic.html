   	<h3>Overview of preservation management</h3>
   	<a href="#tips">
Jump to the Useful Tips Section</a>
<p>•	Information professionals esp. record keeping professionals have long realized the importance of preservation of information materials by acknowledging that such materials in their custody require safe keeping.</p>
<p>•	Sir Hillary Jenkinson  for instance stated that archivists / records managers have a responsibility towards both moral and physical defence of archives/records
</p>
<p>••••	Moral defence refers to the intellectual processes undertaken to ensure sound records/archives mgt.
</p>
<p>••••	Physical defence refers to the physical care and security required to ensure that the materials are preserved.
</p>

<p><b>•	Although deterioration of infor. Materials has been recognized as a problem for many centuries, the problem is more acute today due to a combination of factors:</b>
</p>
<p><i>  •proliferation and use of brittle paper in most offices and organizations today including recycled paper
</i></p>
<p><i>  •The dramatic increasing use of new technologies and the prevalence of electronic information materials in most organizations (has created a whole new range of preservation concerns and challenges
</i></p>
<p>This has no doubt increased the vulnerability of information resources and at the same time accelerated the need to deal with the various preservation challenges which they pose.
</p>
<p>•	Preservation is therefore one of several underlying concepts that are generally included in mission and goals statements of information centres
</p>
<p>• To many preservation is the very cornerstone upon which information centres especially so archival institutions are founded.
</p>
<p>• While preservation is a primary goal or responsibility of information centres, an equally 
</p>
<p>• Compelling mandate – access and use- sets up a classic conflict that must be arbitrated by the custodians and caretakers of information materials 
</p>
<p>• The dual responsibilities of preserving and making materials available for use require that information centres/ archival institutions  balance sometimes conflicting needs, set priorities and allocate scarce resources judiciously when managing information centre programs.
</p>
 <h4>Definition of Terms</h4>
<p><strong>Preservation- </strong>has been defined by different scholars and professionals in different ways </p>
<p><strong>• Millar & Roper (1999) </strong>operations involved in the protection of information materials against damage or deterioration.
 </p>
<p>•<strong>O’Toole (1989)- </strong>defines it as the processes geared to providing a level of environmental control, housing, care and maintenance that will retard further chemical deterioration and protect materials from physical damage
 </p>
<p>• <strong>ICA (1989)-</strong>defines it as a basic archival function of storing and protecting records and archives/information materials for the purpose of ensuring their continued stability, availability, retrievability and usability.
</p>
<p>• <strong>Ritzenthaler (1993)- </strong>sharing the above view describes preservation as a basic function and integral component of archives management. She further describes preservation as consisting of a wide variety of interrelated activities designed to prolong the usable life of information materials
 </p>
<p>From all the above definitions, preservation encompasses the following:
</p>
<p>-Activities that prolong the usable life of information materials;
</p>
<p>-Activities designed to minimize the loss of information content (intellectual) of information materials;
 </p>
<p>-Activities concerned with the remedial treatment of damaged information materials with the aim of returning them as near as possible to their original state;
</p>
<p>-Activities concerned with the remedial treatment of damaged information materials with the aim of returning them as near as possible to their original state;
 </p>
<p><strong>Digital Preservation – Pujar (2008) -</strong>defines digital preservation as a process of maintaining, in a condition suitable for use, materials produced in digital formats including the preservation of bit stream and the continued ability to render or display the content represented by the bit stream
 </p>
<p><strong>Conservation- Patkus (2003)</strong> defines conservation as the reactive treatment of information materials in order to strengthen them physically or stabilize them chemically thus sustaining their survival as long as possible in their original form
</p>
<p><strong>Ritzenthaler - </strong>observes that conservation is generally considered to be one aspect of an overall preservation program that aims to stabilize information materials in their original format by chemical and physical means.
 </p>
<p>Conservation is therefore carried out for the following purposes:
</p>
<p>- To return deteriorated items to stable and usable condition;
 </p>
<p>- To render information materials capable of being safely duplicated
</p>
<p><strong>Deterioration </strong>– a gradual process of physical or chemical change or damage to information materials that if left unchecked could turn catastrophic.
 </p>
<p><strong>Examination </strong>- This is a preliminary diagnostic process that is undertaken before any repair or recovery is done on information materials. It involves a thorough inspection of affected information materials to determine </p>
<p>• Extent of damage to information materials
</p>
<p>• Type of information material and materials from which it is made from</p>
<p>• Physical and chemical stability of the information materials and whether it can withstand repair or any form of treatment
</p>
<p>• Type of treatment and/or repair appropriate for the type of the material and recovery process
</p>


<h4>Maintenance and Good Housekeeping</h4>
<p>Maintenance refers to the day to day care of information materials in a secure and controlled environment.
</p>
<p>The key to maintenance is good housekeeping. This demands that information materials are maintained in a clean, healthy, dust-free, pollution-free environment and in storage conditions free of biological pests. It also demands that information materials are handled with care to prevent any form of damage.

</p>
<p><strong>Lignin –</strong> An acidic substance that is a natural product of all wooded plants. It is non-carbohydrate, non-fibrous substance in the cell walls of living plants that is responsible for their strength and rigidity but that in paper contributes to its degradation
 </p>
<p><strong>Acidity</strong> – This refers to the amount of acid concentration in any given product. Acids contain high levels of positively charged hydrogen ions which are the cause of damage to paper products
</p>
<h4>Role of Information Centres</h4>

<p>• Information centres (registries, records centres, archives, libraries, documentation centres, workstations etc) worldwide are established for purposes of preserving information materials for use by various user groups(researchers, govt and business executives, general public, organizations and institutions, journalists etc)
</p>
<p>• Archival institutions are specifically established for purposes of preserving archival records which convey the nation’s history and memory.
</p<p>• For >
that matter, records and archives are regarded as the treasure houses of information and knowledge as well as memory of societies the world over and thus needs to be preserved so that they can continue to be accessible to the public for use over time.
 </p>

<h4>The Aim and Objectives of Preservation Management</h4>
<p>•	Preservation management is the most cost-effective manner of protecting information materials from any form of damage or deterioration. It has a no. of objectives but not limited to:
 </p>
<p>•	Prolonging the usable life of information materials
</p>
<p>•	Implementation of Best Practices in the care of information materials irrespective of form or medium. This can be achieved by adhering to various quality standards such as ISO 9000 and 9001 Quality Management and Quality Assurance Standards among others
</p>
<p>•	Ensuring that all information materials are protected and maintained securely in a manner commensurate with their value and use
</p>
<p>•	Ensuring that information materials are managed throughout their life in the medium most appropriate for access, retrieval and use
</p>
<p>•	Preserving information materials in a manner that safeguards their integrity and quality
</p>
<p>•	Enhancing the safety and security of information materials and related resources. This is achieved through provision of a conducive environment for storage of information materials, good housekeeping, provision of good security, and detection of hackers and ensuring that no unauthorized persons accesses the information
</p>
<p>•	Ensuring continued availability, accessibility, retrievability and usability of information materials over time. This is very important for digital records because of their inherent challenges
 </p>
<p>•	Preventing total loss of information materials by identifying vital information materials and protecting them by adopting vital information protection programs as well as disaster management programmes
</p>
<p>•	Adopting preventive measures that safeguard information materials from any form of deterioration, thus helping organizations save money meant for conservation treatment.
</p>
<p>•	Contributing to preservation of the cultural, historical, business and intellectual heritage of mankind
 </p>
<p>Preservation management therefore ensures that information materials are protected through various interventions including:
</p>
<p>• Preventive preservation that seeks to reduce or minimize risks of damage to information materials by providing suitable storage environment
</p>
<p>• Prescriptive preservation that sets out to identify damaged materials and to facilitate their treatment to bring them back to their original state (conservation)
 </p>
<p>• Reformatting of the information materials to alternative formats to facilitate continued access
</p>



<h2 align="center">Topic 2 </h2>
<h2>Methods and Techniques of Preservation Management</h2>
<h3>Preventive Preservation</h3>

<p>Preventive preservation seeks to create an ideal environment which as far as is possible prevents or slows down deterioration and in so doing helps to preserve the physical and chemical integrity of materials.
</p>
<p>The effectiveness of this approach depends very much on the knowledge of the characteristics of information materials in the custody of the concerned information center and the factors and agents that are most likely to cause deterioration
 </p>
<p>However, if preventive methods or strategies of preservation are put in place early enough, it is possible that conservation can be avoided or at least minimized
 </p>
<p>Preventive preservation therefore involves putting in place various protective measures that will pre-empt the many forms of deterioration
</p>
<p>It may include a variety of measures as follows:
 </p>
<p>• Taking proper care of the building which houses the information materials;
</p>
<p>• Providing adequate storage facilities
</p>
<p>• Providing direct physical protection 
 </p>
<p>• Ensuring proper environmental controls; and adopting Integrated Pest Management Strategies.
</p>
<h4>Building Standards
</h4>
<p>Information center buildings must be designed and constructed in a manner that provides an ideal environment for the storage and preservation of information materials as well as for the comfort of staff and users
 </p>
<p>One important consideration for the siting of such buildings is that the site must be free from the risks of infestation by insects, rodents, flooding, dust, pollution and civil strife.
</p>
<p>Storage areas should not be situated in basements of buildings. If this is done for security and other reasons, environmental conditions must be regulated to make them ideal for the storage and preservation of materials
 </p>
<p>The costs for creating such artificial environments may be prohibitive for many information centres and must be thought of carefully beforehand
</p>
<p>There are two types of buildings for the storage and preservation of information materials
</p>
<p>• Purpose-built (specifically planned and designed)
</p>
<p>• Converted buildings (planned and designed for other purposes)
</p>
<p>The purpose-built buildings often have all the required facilities and environmental conditions to meet the storage needs of information materials
</p>
<p>The converted buildings will pose storage problems since the right specifications for the storage of information materials were not considered and must therefore be provided for irrespective of the costs involved
</p>
<p>A building intended to house information materials must meet a series of building standards that protect both the life of the staff and also the information materials
 </p>
<p>Such standard include: all materials used for walls, the foundations and the roof must be fire-proof;
 </p>
<p>• The building must meet proper thermal installation standards
</p>
<p>• Storage areas must be sited away from areas of direct sunlight
</p>
<p>• Storage areas must be fitted with fireproof doors
</p>
<p>• There must be emergency exists for easy evacuation of materials and of staff in case of disasters (fire)
</p>
<p>• Roofs should be completely water proof and burglar proof
</p>
<p>• No pipes should pass through storage areas to minimize accumulation of water vapour (humidity)
</p>
<p>• Security alarms, fire alarms, burglar alarms, smoke detectors, gas detectors etc should be fitted
</p>
<p>• Equipment such as fire extinguishers should also be fitted, these should regularly be checked and serviced and the staff be trained on their use.
</p>
<p>• Fire drills should also be done periodically to check the alertness of the staff and users and consequently raise awareness on disaster preparedness on both the staff and the users
</p>


<h3>Integrated Pest Management</h3>
<p>It is a well known fact that biological agents including rodents, termites, silverfish, cockroaches, booklice and beetles are a problem and damage information materials in various ways
</p>
<p>Pests find their way to repositories some times as part of incoming materials (archival records) or on their own through the finest of inlets.
</p>
<p>Many information centres have spent a lot of resources through the purchase of over the counter chemical products such pesticides and fungicides in order to control biological pests but without much success
</p>
<p>Some experts point out that what chemical products do it merely to create super pests that are resistant to pesticides
</p>
<p>The harmful effect of pesticides used in fumigation to humans has further discouraged their use especially in developed countries where these have been banned from use</p>
<p>As a result new methods of controlling pests without the use of pesticides have emerged
</p>
<p>One example is known as the “least chemical approach” commonly referred to as Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
</p>
<p>IPM involves controlling conditions in and around storage buildings, controlling the micro-climate of the storage areas, cleaning archival documents before integrating with those in the repository and understanding the insect life cycle or habits
</p>
<p>The whole idea about IPM is therefore to forestall or pre-empt treatment before infestation by biological agents which would end up with fumigation having to take place.
</p>
<p>The IPM strategy involves various measures including:
</p>
<p>• Regular monitoring of pest activity and understanding insect lifecycles with recognition that the larvae stage is the most damaging </p>
<p>• Checking of all information materials especially archival materials before it enters the repository
</p>
<p>• Use of mouse and rat traps in place of toxic chemicals which kill them in ceilings or cracks of walls thus providing food for other insects pests such as the carpet bettle
</p>
<p>• Clearing all bushes and plant debri from the exterior of storage buildings which ends up controlling the entry of cockroaches, rats or mice
</p>
<p>• Elimination of damp condition which helps control silverfish and other pests such as mould
</p>
<p>• Placing silica gel in the repository
</p>
<p>• Good housekeeping practices to remove dust, dead insects, and similar food nutrients for biological pests
</p>
<p>• Use of sticky traps to catch insects
</p>
<h3>Prescriptive Preservation</h3>
<p>Conservation treatment involves direct intervention with information materials to render them as physically and chemically stable as possible. 
 </p>
<p>The degree of intervention depends on the nature of the materials, their condition, value, and anticipated uses as well as on institutional resources.
</p>
<p>Given the expense, individual conservation treatment is often reserved for records of the highest value.
</p>
<h3>Treatment Approaches</h3>
<p>•Mass conservation procedures are seen by some as the most viable hope for long-term keeping of large archival, manuscript, and library collection.
 </p>
<p>• In theory, mass procedures allow high volume treatment of materials evidencing the same problem; individual handling is thus minimized and the cost of treatment per item radically reduced.
</p>
<p>• Examples of such measures include: deacidification; fumigation and paper strengthening techniques 
</p>
<p>• Archival materials are less likely candidates for most mass than are library materials given the eclectic nature of archival collections and the great diversity of materials and formats that can be encountered in even a single archives box.
</p>
<h4>Other Conservation Techniques</h4>
<p><strong>Tissue Repairs</strong>- Japanese tissue paper is used to reinforce both sides of a document. 
 </p>
<p>• Its advantage is seen in the speed of treatment and the fact that it does not require specialized skills.
</p>
<p>• It is also transparent and thus can be used in documents written on both sides
</p>
<p>• It is reversible
</p>
<p><strong>Lamination –</strong> a document is sand-witched between a japanese tissue paper and cellulose acitate film either by hand or by use of a laminating machine
 </p>
<p>• If done by machine, the heat used is harmful to documents
</p>
<p>• It is quite difficult to reverse lamination and where a machine is used it is fairly expensive</p>
<p><strong>Full Pasting –</strong> Hand made paper is used to reinforce a document and give it protection. It is only used in documents written on one side since the hand made paper is not transparent
</p>
<p>• It is not time consuming
</p>
<p><strong>Leaf Casting –</strong> This involves the repair of a document by filling in the missing areas with paper pulp.
</p>
<p>• The area in a document which requires to be filled with pulped requires some calculation so that the process of filling does not create new holes or a new layer of pulp on the surface of a document
</p>
<p>• The leaf casting machine is very expensive and the process very slow
</p>
<p><strong>In-laying</strong> - (in-framing) – This is used to repair small sized documents especially damaged on the edges by termites. 
</p>
<p>• A document is protected on both sides by hand paper and japanese tissue paper
</p>
<p><b>Mounting –</b> Maps and charts are reinforced by mounting them on a white cotton material.
 </p>
<p>• Because of their sizes map presents storage problems thus map sectioning is called for or is necessary before mounting
</p>
<p><b>Binding –</b> This is the permanent fastening usually between covers to keep a document in a fixed order and to assist in protecting them. It enables a document to stand on the shelf in perfectly staple non sagging position and allows it to be opened easily to facilitate reading and copying 
</p>
<p><b>Chiffon repair – </b>This technique is similar to tissue repair but it is used to repair maps and other oversized documents. The document is sand witched between two pieces of chiffon clothes
</p>
<p><b>Encapsulation –</b> This involves trapping a document between two sheets of polyester material which is then shielded or fastened at the edges. The process differs from lamination since the document is not stack to the encapsulating material
 </p>
 <h3>Reformatting</h3>
<p>When information materials are extremely fragile, heavily used, deteriorating or highly valuable, it is a common practice to have them reformatted to alternative media the most common being microfilming and digitizing
</p>
<p>The choice of the media to adopt depends on the following factors:
</p>
<h4>Purpose for format conversion</h4>
 
<p>This should be clear since different formats may be suitable for different purpose. It should be considered for example whether the purpose is:
 </p>
<p>• Substitution where the  new version replacing a deteriorated version;
 </p>
<p>• Security where the new version provides a back up to a rear or unique material;
</p>
<p>• Compaction  where a new version replaces a bulky original e.g. news  papers;
</p>
<p>• Conservation where a new version is used for normal reference;
</p>
<p>• Dissemination where many copies of the new version is made available for use at many different locations.
</p>

<h4>User needs 
</h4>
<p>• Several questions will have to be answered with regard to user needs before choosing a media:
</p>
<p>• The ease  with which users will be able to identify, retrieve and interpreter the information held in the new media;
</p>
<p>• How urgently users located in far way locations may be able to retrieve such information;
</p>
<p>• The volume of access to information  that is anticipated
</p>

<h4>Technical issues
</h4>
<p>This relates to the following:
</p>
<p>• Life expectancy of the new media. This is important in order to reduce the cost associated with migration into a different medium in the future;
</p>
<p>• Special preservation measures to ensures the physical safety of the new media;
</p>
<p>• The extent to  which a specific technological system is essential for access to information in the new format(media) i.e H/Ware and S/ware dependency;
</p>
<p>• The existence of standards that promote confidence in the quality of the new format i.e standards  for facilitating further format conversion on changing of technology as well as standards  for the physical preservation  of the media.
</p>
<h4>Relative costs
</h4>
<p>This includes: 
</p>
<p>• The cost of conversion to secondary format;
</p>
<p>• The cost  of maintenance and storage of the new media;
</p>
<p>• Costs associated with access to information;
</p>
<p>• Costs of re- conversion to another format in the event of technological obsolescence;
</p>
<p>• Costs of equipment, materials, personnel e.t.c required.

</p>
<h4>Nature & Variety of Materials
</h4>
<p>It is important to decide whether the following materials will be included in the format conversion programs.
 </p>
<p>• Printed books </p>
<p>• Non-textual Information materials e.g.  audio visual
</p>
<p>• Manuscripts 
</p>
<p>• Archives
</p>
<p><b>Microfilming</b> – This is the photographic process of creating miniaturized images of information on high-resolution film.
</p>
<p>Microfilming concentrates information into a compact and relatively easy-to-use form so that so much information may be stored in a small space and read using microfilm or microfiche readers
 </p>
 
 <h3>Benefits of microfilming</h3>
<p>• It dramatically reduces the space required for keeping large collections of information;
</p>
<p>• Although it is expensive to produce initially, microfilming is relatively low cost to duplicate and ship, making an ideal medium for publishing textual research materials;
</p>
<p>• A properly produced microfilm copy is recognized legally as an acceptable substitute for originals;
</p>
<p>• Providing multiple copies of records within or outside the repository without damaging or risking originals;
</p>
<p>• Preserving the original order of records preventing disorder or loss of information;
</p>
<p>• Ensuring the safe preservation of information through the provision of security copies of documents;
</p>
<p>• Protecting original copies by providing copies for research use
</p>
<p>• Saving money, particularly in an office environment through reductions on storage space, increase in speed of retrieval and improved security.
</p>


<h4>Drawbacks of microfilm application
</h4>
<p>• Since it is a black and white medium, it is difficult to copy color originals effectively;
</p>
<p>• Poorly organized records will be more difficult to use on microfilm, as disorganized information is more difficult to retrieve;
</p>
<p>• Microfilming is costly and so if poorly planned can be a heavy expense without adequate benefits;
</p>
<p>• In some countries it may not be admissible in courts of law;
</p>
<p>• The preservation of microfilm requires good quality environmental conditions which can be difficult to achieve;
</p>
<p>• It requires high technical stds if these are not achieved the benefits of microfilming are outweighed by the drawbacks of poorly produced or rapidly deteriorating films
</p>
<p>• It requires readers or printers for both staff anf public use;
</p>
<p>• May cause eyestrains and fatique.
</p>
<p>Microfilming can therefore be applied for the following purposes:
</p>
<p><b>Security copying</b>
</p>
<p>Archival institutions make copies of documents in their custody in order to have a substitute if the original is destroyed through a disaster or some other cause of deterioration. Security copies should never be used except where no substitute is available. The requirements of a security copy include 
 </p>
<p>Durability should be more than 100 years
</p>
<p>Should be capable of being copied with little loss of quality• </p>
<p>Should be kept in a different location
</p>
<p>Should reproduce all written information of the original document
</p>

<h4>Preservation copying
</h4>
<p>This is done in order to avail to researchers copies of original materials. The preservation principle is normally tied to the security principle. However, there are cases which might warrant the use of original material by researchers e.g. where a researcher is carrying out a specialized study , If the existing archival legislation specify the use of original material and if a researcher has eye sight problems
 </p>
 
 <h4>Acquisition copying
</h4>
<p>• This is done for various reasons
</p>
<p>• To have copies of collections which are preserved elsewhere.
</p>
<p>• To complete collections of an infor. centre with related materials and by means of this increase the information value of its holding.
</p>
<p>• To make up documents which are missing from an information collection i.e filling up the gaps due to disasters, transfer etc.
</p>
<p>• To establish a new collection on setting selected topics relating to an historical era, group or territory
</p>
<p>• To remedy or settle temporary an archival claim where two or more countries claim for themselves the same materials.
</p>

<h4>Disposal copying
</h4>
<p>Institution may choose to make copies of original document and retain the copies while destroying originals which release expensive storage space.  This is true in regard to newspapers which present storage problems due to their numbers, size and quality of paper in which they are printed.  However copying followed by destruction is generally not acceptedin most archival institutions.  An institution therefore needs to consider the cost of disposal copying verses construction of more storage areas/rooms.
</p>
<h4>Publication Copying
</h4>





<p>• This enables archival institutions to make copies of records, finding aids, preserved in order to publicize them to the interested users because of various reasons;
</p>
<p>• The growing information demand of researches.
</p>
<p>• The high cost of printing
</p>
<p>• The increasing role of archives in public life.
</p>

<h3>Digitization</h3>
<p>It is the transfer of information from paper system to electronic format.  
</p>

<h4>Benefits of Digitization as a Preservation Reformatting Option
</h4>
<p>•	Benefits of using digitization as a reformatting method for paper-based materials include:
 </p>
<p>• Increased accessibility
</p>
<p>• Increased functionality
</p>
<p>Users can simultaneously compare selected digital page images of originals</p>
<p>digital images can be converted to searchable text files to enable searching and analysis of   content within and across works, independent of location
</p>
<p>digital copies can be manipulated (enlarged and contrast changed) to support some types of art factual study
</p>
<p>users can have cut and paste options for ease of citation, etc.</p>
<p>Output capability to other media
</p>
<p>• can create printed facsimiles in accordance with   preservation specifications to meet user needs
</p>
<p>• can generate computer output microfilm that meets preservation specifications</p>
<p>• can generate multiple digital copies without loss of quality
</p>
<p>Systematic and purposeful collaboration
 </p>
<p>• once one institution has digitized a collection/work, multiple institutions can easily access it and integrate into their own virtual collections, subject to relevant copyright restrictions</p>
<p>• Digital reformatting has the ability to capture and display a broad array of materials with features and characteristics that are not easily reformatted using other technologies (e.g.,color items, oversize materials and other complex graphic materials)
</p>
<p>• Digitization can address the conversion needs of other types of media beyond paper-based Printed materials (e.g., audio, film, video) and can allow collections containing a wide variety of formats to be presented and seamlessly accessed from a single interface
</p>
<h4>Issues of concern</h4>
<p>While electronic images take up less space their long term stability is not guaranteed. As a result, many professional conservators do not recommend digitization as a long term preservation mechanism.
 </p>
<p>Digitization is an expensive process because not only are there costs associated with the purchase and use of equipment but there are other hidden costs e.g. the need to review, preview and edit all digitized items to ensure accuracy.
 </p>
<p>All digitized materials are not yet acceptable in courts of law and need to retain the original in paper formats.  This puts into question the purpose of digitization.
</p>
<p>Technological obsolescence - This relates to whether the technology to read digitized materials will be available in years to come.
</p>
<p>Digital technology in relatively young as compared to other media e.g. paper and micrographic.  There is therefore a general lack of confidence in its use.
</p>

<h4>Summary
</h4>
<p>The debate on the use of digitization as a preservation strategy is growing in popularity in the archival community because digitization seems to offer excellent prospects for significant benefits for both the archives and archives users; but it also raises considerable preservation problems.
 </p>

 <h2>Planning for a preservation management programme</h2>
 <h4>Preservation survey – Institutional level
</h4>
<p>A sound preservation programme must be based on a thorough understanding of the physical plant and environment; the range, formats and conditions of the collection, policies and the institutional organization structure.
</p>
<p>As a result of such a survey, a needs assessment statement can be written and used to design a preservation program that is developed incrementally over time.</p>


<h4>Preservation survey – collection level
</h4>
<p>Following a review of repository-wide conditions and policies, attention should be directed towards the need of individual collections, especially for improved housing and reformatting or repository
</p>
<p>To do this, one can integrate data gathering with on-going information centre functions by for instance having survey forms filled whenever problems are noted during accessioning or processing activities or before reshelving after every use ; alternatively, a special project could be undertaken to collect the data.
 </p>
<p>The data collected serves as a framework for long range preservation planning 
</p>

<h4>Establishing preservation priorities
</h4>
<p>Data gathered on the physical needs collection must be considered in combination with available resources and the relative values and projected uses of the materials as the basis for assigning preservation priorities
 </p>
<p>Information materials may be regarded from a number of perspectives and values attached accordingly. In part, the assignment of values will determine which information materials must be maintained in the original format, and which  ones must be copied or reformatted to preserve their informational content
</p>
<h4>Preservation decision making
</h4>
<p>Once you know where you are, it is possible to decide where you wish to go and how to get there as expeditiously as possible.
 </p>
<p>B4 preservation decision making, infor. must be gathered, organized, and analyzed on the preservation needs of the holdings and the relative values of the collections
 </p>
<p>All these must be balanced against financial and staff resources and available technical expertise
</p>
<p>Preservation decision making at the collection level involves deciding among collections (which one presents the greatest priority for attention) as well as deciding what the appropriate actions are for a given collection 
 </p>
<p>Decisions made among collections take into consideration relative importance and value on the one hand and the degree of need on the other
 </p>
 
 
 <h4>Preservation budget</h4>

<p>The amount of money that should be budgeted for preservation activities will depend on the size and needs of the collection; the number of discrete program areas and the number of staff members with sole or partial preservation responsibility. Supplies, equipment and services also must figure into the equation.

</p>
<p>• Funds budgeted for preservation should grow incrementally on an annual basis to reflect and support program development and expansion until a mature program is achieved at which point major budget growth would level off
</p>
<p>• The preservation programme must receive consistent, ongoing institutional support if it is to make any process
</p>
<h3>Storage and Handling Materials in Different Formats</h3>
<p>• Information centres are known to house a wide variety of information materials.
</p>
<p>• Although these materials require a basic standard of care, some would require more attention and protection because they are difficult or impossible to replace.
</p>
<p>• Good storage of the information materials in a risk-free environment is one of the most important actions that can be taken.
</p>


<h4>Paper Records and cartographic records
</h4>
<p>This include any documented information on a paper base including such materials as maps and plans on paper backing.
</p>
<p>• Ideally they should be kept in total darkness but since this is rarely achievable then exposure to light should be limited to the shortest time possible.
 </p>
<p>• When exhibiting such materials light levels should be kept as low as possible ideally not more that 50 lux.
</p>
<p>• Ideal temp. and humidity levels should be between 18 to 20 degrees Celsius and 35-45% respectively
</p>
<p>• Particular care should be taken when handling large items such as maps.
 </p>
<p>• Folded papers should be flattened if possible since repeated folding will break down the strength of the paper speeding up deterioration
</p>
<p>• Ideally, paper archives should be stored in acid-free file folders with a thickness of not more than 1-2 centimeters of  documents per folder.
</p>
<p>• It is best to keep archives in acid free boxes to keep out water, light, predators and dust. If acid-free boxes are not available, any boxes are better than none
</p>
<p>• If boxes are not available the records can be wrapped in unbleached cotton cloth or tied with unbleached cotton tape. 
</p>
<p>• They should never be stored in containers that once held any kind of food products
</p>
<p>• If a particular paper records are in high demand, the institution should consider making copies and using these for reference or copying rather than exposing originals to continued light and handling.
</p>


<h4>Books and other publications
</h4>
<p>• Some books and publications are more easily replaceable but others are rare and perhaps unique.
</p>
<p>• Books can be made of a variety of materials including paper, leather, vellum, cloth, boards and adhesives. 
</p>
<p>• In general the temp recommended for paper materials applies equally to books.
</p>
<p>• However they require slightly higher RH of about 45-50% but should be kept away from excess RH
 </p>
<p>• They are best kept in an environment as dark as possible and should be protected from strong light as well (50 lux or less)
</p>
<p>• They should be removed from shelves carefully without pulling on the spine.
</p>
<p>• When opening a book it should not be pressed flat
</p>
<p>• They should be stored upright if possible unless it is particularly fragile
</p>
<p>• Extremely fragile books could be stored in boxes or tied with cotton tape.
</p>
<p>• Damaged books should never be repaired using adhesive tapes or glues
</p>

<h4>Parchment and  vellum 
</h4>
<p>• These are resistant to acid attack because of the nature of their manufacture.
</p>
<p>• They are durable if stored correctly but very susceptible to extremes and fluctuations of RH
</p>
<p>• They should be exposed to as little light as possible
</p>
<p>• Temp of 18 – 20 or cooler are agreeable, RH of 50 – 55%  are best and fluctuations should be avoided as much as possible
</p>
<p>• They should be stored in boxes, drawers or on shelve inside strong file folders
</p>
<p>• They should be unfolded, flat and under minimal pressure
</p>
<h4>Newspapers
</h4>
<p>These are physically very unstable and an exceptionally poor medium for long term preservation
</p>
<p>• The best course of action would be to microfilm them and preserve the original if necessary.
</p>
<p>• If the original are kept they should be stored out of any light as acidic paper will deteriorate even more quickly when exposed to light, heat or excessively dry air.
</p>
<p>• Temp should be below 20 degrees Celcius and RH of 40-45%
</p>
<p>• They should be kept in a made to measure acid-free boxes. 
</p>
<p>• Alternatively, they should be wrapped in acid-free paper and stored separately from other materials.
</p>
<p>• The box or wrapping should be clearly marked so that it is easy to retrieve the correct bundle when necessary.
</p>
<p>• Binding them is to be discouraged as this makes future preservation work much more difficult and ultimately accelerates deterioration.
</p>


<h4>Works of Art on Paper
</h4>
<p>This include such materials as oil paintings, watercolors or  other artistic items
 </p>
<p>•	These materials are either framed or unframed. If framed, they should be left within their frames unless the frames are highly acidic or are causing damage to the paper within.
</p>
<p>• Framed items can be hung on an interior wall away from sunlight or any source of heat. They should hung securely so that they are well supported on the wall ideally from two points.
</p>
<p>• Unframed items are best stored in a box or container that does not put extra pressure on the surface but protects the item from dust and light.
</p>
<p>• If framed paintings cannot be hung, then they should be stacked upright in a secure area.
</p>
<p>• They should be rested on a piece of cotton cloth or carpet and separated with good quality heavy cardboard to protect the frames and glass.
</p>
<p>• Alternatively a wooden storage rack can be built with slots in it to hold framed materials and keep them separate from other items.
</p>
<p>• Light levels for storage and display should be lower than 150 lux
</p>
<p>• The best temp is 18-20 degree Celsius and RH of 45 and 55% which should remain as stable as possible.
</p>
<p>• When handling these materials, they should never be touched on the surface and no attempt should be made to clean them other than gently dusting them with a soft brush.
</p>


<h4>Photographic Materials
</h4>
<p>These come in two broad categories each requiring different environmental conditions:</p>
<h5>Photographic Prints</h5>

<p>These consists of two parts: an image layer and a support layer. The support layer is usually composed of paper though it may be made of glass, metal or other materials
</p>
<p>• The image layer is composed of a number of chemicals and the more chemicals the more complex the photograph.
</p>
<p>•	Black and white photographic images consist of silver, embedded in a gelatin, albumen or collodion binder (emulsion layer)
 </p>
<p>• Colour images are composed of a number of organic dyes embedded in three layers of gelatin.
</p>
<p>• Black and white photographs are fairly stable to light whereas colour images are sensitive to light, can fade in dark and easily affected by temperature and RH
</p>
<p>Photographic prints are best kept at temperatures below 20 degrees Celcius and the following RH levels:
</p>
<p>• 30 – 35% for black and white
</p>
<p>• 25 -30 % for colour
</p>
<p>• 20 – 30 % for materials in cold storage
</p>
<p>• Photographic materials should be stored in total darkness and exposure to light should be at the lowest intensity possible (50lux)
</p>
<p>• Handling should be with gloves at all times.
</p>
<p>• They should not be bend or folded and paper clips, staples or other attachments should not be used
</p>
<p>• Storage areas should be free of dust and any cleaning materials that might give off polluting chemical fumes or acids. Ideally they should be stored in individual enclosures to shield them from dust, dirt, handling and the environment.
</p>
<h4>Photographic Negatives, Slides and Transparencies</h4>

<p>• Like prints these also is composed of an image layer and support layer.
</p>
<p>• The support is generally made of polyester, cellulose acetate or cellulose nitrate film.
</p>
<p>• The image layer of a black and white negative is usually composed of silver particles embedded in gelatin. 
</p>
<p>• The image layer of colour negatives also contains silver particles which are bleached during development action which affects the stability of colour negatives.
</p>
<p>• Slides are similar to negatives but are positive imges whose colours are formed from organic dyes
</p>
<p>• Photographic negatives are best kept at temperatures below 20 degrees Celcious and RH indicated below:
</p>
<p>• 30 – 35%vfor films and slides
</p>
<p>• 25 – 30 % for glass plate negatives and glass slides
</p>

<h4>Magnetic and electronic media
</h4>
<p>• They should be stored in their original containers as long as they are clean and can retard fire.
</p>
<p>• They should be protected from direct light and dust
</p>
<p>• Temperatures should be kept at 18 – 20 degrees Celcious and RH between 40 and 50%
</p>
<p>• Fluctuations of Temp and RH should be avoided by all means.
</p>
<p>• Ideally they should be handled with clean cotton cloves.
</p>
<p>• All storage areas should be kept free of dust as much as is possible
</p>

<h3>Principles of Conservation Management </h3>
<p>When determining what preservation work to undertake, the following core principles must be respected: </p>
<p><b>All restoration must be reversible</b>  – This principle states that to a degree possible, no procedure or treatment should be undertaken on information materials that cannot later if necessary be undone without causing harm to the information materials. The relevance of this principle lies on the fact that there is continued research on preservation in general and this might necessitate the need to undo a given treatment in preference of newer techniques.  Furthermore, a given treatment might react with the materials and thus need to reverse it.
</p>


<h3>Principle of Compatibility</h3>
<p>• This addresses the compatibility of the problem and the solution. It states that it is appropriate to apply a treatment technique that is equal to the problem being remedied and vice versa. The compatibility should be in terms of color, strength and nature of materials used e.g. one can’t use leather to repair a damaged paper. 
 </p>
<p>• This principle ensures that the integrity and authenticity of a document is maintained.
</p>
<h3>Principle of Economy</h3>
<p>•	This addresses the compatibility of the problem and the solution. It states that it is appropriate to apply a treatment technique that is equal to the problem being remedied and vice versa. The compatibility should be in terms of color, strength and nature of materials used e.g. one can’t use leather to repair a damaged paper. 
 </p>
<p>•	Preservation is costly and so this principle should be observed as much as is possible
 </p>
 <h3>Principle of Stabilization</h3>
<p>• This states that conservation work is meant to merely stabilize documents so as to conserve its value but not to replace it. This means that at all times the repair work done on a document should be minimal and should not compromise the integrity of the document. The documents should therefore remain as original as possible after the treatment procedures have been carried out</p>

<h3>Principle of Documentation</h3>
<p>This principle states that all treatment undertaken or performed on an information material must be documented. All the materials used and procedures followed should therefore be recorded. This will assist in reversing the treatment if need arises.  Further, this documentation will assist the conservator asses any reaction that might occur between the materials used and the information material.
</p>
<p> This will also provide a complete and accurate record of any changes in the information material as a means to enhance authenticity and integrity of the document especially on legal issues. The relevance of this principle is that it assists conservators avoid duplication of efforts by carrying out the same treatment on a document. It also facilitates the study of various treatment techniques. 
 </p>
 <h3>Principle of Antiquarian Value</h3>
<p>• states that the procedures and materials used should not interfere with the intrinsic value of a document. After treatment, the document should continue to serve the purpose it was created for or preserved for. This principle enhances authenticity of information materials.
</p>
<p>The following general guidelines should be respected by anyone involved with preservation work
</p>
<p>• Preservation should be undertaken on a macro scale
</p>
<p>• Focus on preventive rather than prescriptive work
</p>
<p>• Establish a base line of care for all holdings
</p>
<p>• Ensure that storage methods and facilities do not endanger the integrity or authenticity of documentary materials
</p>
<p>• Document all treatments fully both before and after work is done
</p>
<p>• Interfere with originals as little as possible
</p>
<p>• Validate new technologies by careful and authoritative testing before use
</p>
<p>• Use no process or materials that can weaken the material of which the record is made
