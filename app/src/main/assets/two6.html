   	<h3>General Project Estimation Approach</h3>
<p>The Project Estimation Approach that is widely used is Decomposition Technique. </p>
<p>Decomposition techniques take a divide and conquer approach. Size, Effort and Cost estimation are performed in a stepwise manner by breaking down a Project into major Functions or related Software Engineering Activities.</p>
<h5>Step 1 − Understand the scope of the software to be built.</h5>
<h5>Step 2 − Generate an estimate of the software size.</h5>
<p>•	Start with the statement of scope.</p>
<p>•	Decompose the software into functions that can each be estimated individually.</p>
<p>•	Calculate the size of each function.</p>
<p>•	Derive effort and cost estimates by applying the size values to your baseline productivity metrics.</p>
<p>•	Combine function estimates to produce an overall estimate for the entire project.</p>
<h5>Step 3 − Generate an estimate of the effort and cost. You can arrive at the effort and cost estimates by breaking down a project into related software engineering activities.</h5>
<p>•	Identify the sequence of activities that need to be performed for the project to be completed.</p>
<p>•	Divide activities into tasks that can be measured.</p>
<p>•	Estimate the effort (in person hours/days) required to complete each task.</p>
<p>•	Combine effort estimates of tasks of activity to produce an estimate for the activity.</p>
<p>•	Obtain cost units (i.e., cost/unit effort) for each activity from the database.</p>
<p>•	Compute the total effort and cost for each activity.</p>
<p>•	Combine effort and cost estimates for each activity to produce an overall effort and cost estimate for the entire project.</p>
<h5>Step 4 − Reconcile estimates: Compare the resulting values from Step 3 to those obtained from Step 2. If both sets of estimates agree, then your numbers are highly reliable. Otherwise, if widely divergent estimates occur conduct further investigation concerning whether −</h5>
<p>•	The scope of the project is not adequately understood or has been misinterpreted.</p>
<p>•	The function and/or activity breakdown is not accurate.</p>
<p>•	Historical data used for the estimation techniques is inappropriate for the application, or obsolete, or has been misapplied.</p>
<h5>Step 5 − Determine the cause of divergence and then reconcile the estimates.</h5>
