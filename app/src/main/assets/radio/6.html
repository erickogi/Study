<h4>NEWS GATHERING PROCESS</h4>
<p>One of the most fundamental tasks a journalist engages in before writing a story is gathering information. <br/>A key part of that process involves calling, e-mailing or in-person interviewing of people who have knowledge about the subject of the story. Perhaps you need information about the history of a dispute or piece of legislation. Maybe you need to understand what the current status is. <br/>Or you need to reach out to interested parties whose viewpoints have not been represented. You can also use interviews to develop better questions for other interviews. </p>
<p>•	The news gathering process starts with getting story idea(s) from which a story is established. </p>
<p>•	Holding an editorial meeting to discuss major stories. </p>
<p>•	Briefing of reporters by the news editor. </p>
<p>•	Conducting research.  </p>
<p>•	Setting angle for the story (Approach). </p>
<p>•	Getting the story. This is about the sources- choosing the sources.</p>
<h4>INTERVIEWING</h4>
<p>An interview is a special kind of conversation. <br/>It is a conversation between a journalist and a person who has facts or opinions which are likely to be newsworthy. <br/>According to Stewart and Cash (1985), the journalistic interview is a specific type of informative interview where the interviewer solicits and conducts interviews with one or more "sources" to gather supporting material for a news story.<br/> Journalistic interviews are conducted for nearly all forms of mediated news reporting including newspapers, magazines, television, and radio.  </p>
<p> <b>Stages involved in conducting journalistic interviews</b></p>
<p>According to Stewart and Cash (1985), the following ten stages are generally involved in journalistic interviews:  </p>
<p> 1.	<b>Situation and purpose.</b><br/> In this stage, the interviewer determines the specific purpose of the interview, considers how the information obtained will be used, and assesses the nature of the interviewing situation. Any one of these goals may control the others. <br/></p>
<p>For instance, if the end product is a news feature story on a specific topic or person, the length and number of interviews, the interviewees, the specific purpose (to elucidate, observe, discover, examine, expose) and the situation may be predetermined by the use of the information.<br/> Location may prevent us from audio or videotaping an interview for later broadcast over radio or TV. If we conduct an interview via telephone, then we are denied the chance to observe the interviewee and take pictures. Hostile or reluctant interviewees may not allow us to record interviews, to take notes, to identify them in any way or to use direct quotations. 
</p>
<p>2.	<b>Select interviewees.</b><br/> With the situation and purpose clearly in mind, select the interviewee(s) necessary for the report. The situation may determine this selection. For example, when the PM calls a news conference, he is the interviewee. If an editor assigns us to interview the university football coach or the sole survivor of a plane crash, we can move to stage 3. 
In many cases, we have to select one or more interviewees from several survivors, witnesses, experts, or persons with differing points of view. Four criteria should guide this :
 </p>
<p> • <i>Does the interviewee have the information we desire (Key informants)? </i></p>
<p> •	Was the interviewee in a position to observe the event? </p>
<p> •	Was the person involved in determining the policy or course of action?  </p>
<p> •	Do we want information from an expert or do we want to determine the expertise of a respondent? </p>
<p> <i>• Is the interviewee available? </i></p>
<p> •	The interviewee maybe too far from our base (use telephone) or be available only for a few minutes or may not be available until our deadline. </p>
<p> •	May VIPs are hard to access </p>
<p> •	Don’t assume the interviewee is not available, make an appointment. </p>
<p> •	Ask for an interview; contact or go through the PR department, an aide, or follow a chain of command in reach the interviewee with the request for an interview </p>
<p>•<i> Is the interviewee willing to give us the information? </i> </p>
<p> •	Journalists have problems to obtain information from respondents because people like to get their names, faces, voices, and views in the media. So be wary of people who are too anxious to be interviewed. </p>
<p> •	Interviewees may also be reluctant to give information because of mistrust of us or our organization or the media; fear of revealing information potentially harmful to self or others; belief that the information is none of our business or lack of motivation. So let us convince them so that they trust us </p>
<p><i>• Is the interviewee able to transmit the information freely and accurately</i> </p>
<p> •	Any of several problems may make a person unacceptable as a news source: faulty memory, inability to express oneself or communicate ideas, proneness to exaggeration or to oversimplification, unconscious repression or distortion of information, deliberate lying, and a state of shock. </p>
<p>.	The interviewing situation may contribute to transmission problems at the scene of a murder, tornado, fire, auto accident or scandal.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.	<b>Research.</b><br/> We can prepare for many problems if we get to know the interviewee and the situation a head of time. <br/>If time allows, journalists should conduct research into the interviewee as a person, the interviewee’s work and accomplishments, and the topic of the interview.<br/> Learn the interviewee’s biases, values, idiosyncrasies, vested interests, hobbies, reputation, and interviewing traits from articles, other interviewers, the interviewee’s books, articles, speeches and answers during previous interviews.<br/> The information may reveal how the interviewee will act and react during the interview.  </p>
<p> Be fully briefed on the interview topic so we can go beyond the basic, obvious questions and avoid a show of ignorance that may anger the interviewee or embarrass both of us. </p>
<p> 4.	<b>Structure.</b> An interview has an opening, body and ending.<br/> The opening of the interview is first critical step toward establishing an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect that will lead to the accurate, complete information desired. Usually, this involves identifying ourselves, our organization, and the interview topic and explaining how long the interview will take and how the interview data will be used.<br/> Trust is built on truth. </p>
<p>You can open the interview by summarizing the problem or issue, or explain how we or our organization discovered the problem.<br/> For example, I understand you disagree with the new railroad relocation proposal. Would you discuss your reasons for opposing this plan? The journalist may engage in a bit of light conversation before asking serious questions <br/>
The body of the interview except for spot news situations should be moderately scheduled- a listing of basic questions and some possible secondary questions. The moderate schedule permits the journalist to
 </p>
<p>•	Digress from the planned structure when deemed necessary  </p>
<p>•	Adapt to the interviewee  </p>
<p>•	Probe into answers  </p>
<p>•	Delete questions that appear unimportant or irrelevant as the interview progresses  </p>
<p> •	Bypass questions answered during answers to earlier questions </p>
<p> •	Return to a structure if necessary </p>
<p>•	Concentrate on answers instead of being concerned about phrasing the next question </p>
<p> •	Show preparation for, and a sincere interest in the interview </p>
<p>•	Conduct a thorough interview without fear of running out of questions.  </p>
<p>The interview ends when the interviewer has the information needed or time runs out. The interviewer may signal the closing phase with a question such as, And one final question, when do you think the bill will come to the floor for a vote?<br/>The closing is usually brief with an expression of appreciation, notation when and where results will appear, and congragulations for a good interview.  </p>
<p>5.<b> Questions.</b> You are now ready to phrase basic questions. Keep the following rules in mind during both the preparation and interviewing phases of the journalistic process:  </p>
<p>•	Don’t ask bipolar questions  </p>
<p> •	Use clear, precise language, avoiding qualifiers, abstract words, and words with several meanings </p>
<p>•	Don’t make statements; ask questions  </p>
<p>•	Ask relevant questions; determined by topic and purpose  </p>
<p>•	Avoid loaded questions  </p>
<p>•	Avoid lengthy, complex or multiple questions  </p>
<p> •	Ask searching, challenging questions </p>
<p> •	Don’t allow the interviewee to wander too far off target </p>
<p>Press conferences cause problems to journalists as we individually don’t control the interview in any way. Venue, timing, and ground rules for the interview, topics open to discussion, what information may or may not be recorded or reported, and which journalists may attend. will be organized by somebody else (the interviewee or staff). Listen carefully answers given to questions asked by other reporters. </p>
<p>When asking a primary or secondary question, pay close attention to what is being said and how.<br/> Don’t cut in on an interviewee’s answer unless the interviewee is obviously off target or may continue forever. Three special types of secondary questions are effective in interviews:  </p>
<p>• Clearing house probe.<br/> It may appear at the end of the topic or interview e.g. Is there anything we have not covered? Or Are there any other comments you would like to make?  </p>
<p>• Reflective probe and Mirror question. <br/>These two check accuracy of note taking, interpretation of ground rules for the interview and understanding of language and data in answers . Examples:  </p>
<p> •	I take it that you saying.  </p>
<p> •	Do I have this correct? </p>
<p> 6. <b>The Interviewer.</b> Sherwood writes that an ideal interviewer is a person who can ask 160 or 170 questions over a space of few hours. He/she should be an excellent observer and listener, skilled at asking secondary questions, and has the ability to record and interpret answers correctly. However, the interviewing situation or the interviewee may require an ideal interviewer to be of a specific age, sex, race, or ethnic group or with certain personality or style of dress</p>
<p>7.<b> Interviewing.</b>  </p>
<p> How we conduct the interview determines the atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. To establish an atmosphere of trust and respect:</p>
<p>•	Be courteous  </p>
<p>•	Listen carefully to all answers and show it  </p>
<p> •	Keep the interviewee on track (tactfully) and maintain control of the interview </p>
<p> •	Probe to draw out understandable, newsworthy answers </p>
<p>•	Observe personal mannerisms, characteristics, appearance, and nonverbal clues for what they reveal about the interviewee and how he/she feels about the topic, interview and interviewer  </p>
<p>•	Be cautious of overeager interviewees  </p>
<p> •	Be patient </p>
<p>•	Try to put the interviewee at ease  </p>
<p> •	Maintain self control under the most trying conditions </p>
<p> •	If recorders, cameras and lights will be used, prepare the interviewee so that there will be no surprises at the beginning and during the interview hence help reduce interviewee nervousness </p>
<p> •	Strive for accuracy in every aspect of the interview </p>
<p> •	Consider changing the interviewing style as the interview changes: critical to friendly, approving to disapproving, cool to warm </p>
<p>•	Be prepare  </p>
<p><b> DONT</b></p>
<p> •	Prolong interviews needlessly </p>
<p>•	Assume the answer is completed or going nowhere  </p>
<p> •	Provide verbal and nonverbal clues that reveal pleasure or displeasure </p>
<p> •	Use jargon </p>
<p>•	Allow personal biases to intrude into questions and manner  </p>
<p>•	Talk instead of listen  </p>
<p>•	Badger the interviewee without justification  </p>
<p>•	Make assumptions about the topic, interviewee, the situation, your questions, the answers  </p>
<p> •	Strive to be a media personality </p>
<p> •	Be argumentative, an interrogator instead of a journalist </p>
<p> </p>
<p>8. Analysis. Review the data and observations obtained during the interview to establish if the information you obtained satisfies you. We must jog our memory, read through notes, and listen or view tapes recordings.<br/> Check answers with other sources if there is a reason to suspect that the interviewee lied or merely exaggerated.  </p>
<p>9. Editing. Edit the interview data for grammatical errors, mispronounced words, expletives, and vocalized pauses such as uh and uh and um.<br/> Edit long and repetitive statements. Decide whether to quote or paraphrase all responses.  </p>
<p> 10. Preparing the story.</p>
<h5>Handling difficult situations during the interview </h5>
<p>1.<b> Emotional respondents. </b><br/>Interviewees may burst into tears during interviews. 
If we have a close relationship with the interviewee we may hold his/her hand, touch the person’s arm, or put our arms around the person’s shoulders. 
 Remember silence.<br/> Give people the chance to feel, and to gather thoughts and composure without interruption.<br/> They will come back to life to continue with the interview. 
 </p>
<p> 2. <b>Hostile respondents.</b><br/> When we detect hostility in an interviewee we should establish the cause.<br/> The person may feel angry, depressed, helpless, or frightened because of a tragic accident, and we become a convenient target when these feelings are released. The interviewee may have a negative attitude toward us, our profession, or the way the information is likely to be used.<br/> Bad experiences with other interviewers may lead an interviewee to expect the worst from us.<br/> He/she may become hostile to us because of a particular question, the question timing, the way we ask the question nonverbally, or if our questions are too pushing. Avoid pressure tactics. <br/>
Let the interviewee blow off the steam and then try to reduce hostility through careful orientation, by avoidance of any actions that may exacerbate the hostility, and by remaining non-defensive and friendly. Never reply in kind. <br/>
Use a different interviewing strategy to avoid the hostility. For example, you seem to be very upset, would you like to talk about it? 
</p>
<p>3.<b> Reticent (uncommunicative) respondents. </b><br/>If a person seems unwilling or unable to talk, try to discover why. He/she may be inhibited by us, the situation, the surroundings, other people, or microphones and cameras. <br/>If we are using open-ended questions we might switch to closed-ended ones until the interviewee is warmed up and ready to give lengthy answers. <br/>
Use a careful self-instruction, and orientation about the nature, purpose, and use of the interview to open up such an interviewee.<br/> Use silence to motivate people to talk, nudging probes to keep talking, and good listening techniques to people will feel like talking.<br/> Discuss easy, nonthreatening topics during the early minutes of interviews that respondents can address easily and openly. Don’t ask a mother who has lost a child – how did you feel when the car hit your son? 
 </p>
<p> 4. <b>Evasive respondents. </b><br/>Interviewees often try to evade questions that might force them to reveal inner feelings or prejudices, to take specific stands on issues, to make decisions, to reveal decisions that they may have already made, to give specific information, or to incriminate themselves. <br/>Common evasive strategies include humor, counter questions, efforts to answer a different question, requests for rephrasing query or explaining the rationale of the query, and long impressive answers that say very little and avoid direct answers.<br/> Use carefully worded and tactful queries. Occasionally provoke answers by using carefully selected leading and loaded questions. </p>
<p>5. <b>Embarrassing respondents.</b><br/> Interviewees may intentionally or unintentionally embarrass themselves, interviewers or both.  Drop the subject before it gets worse. If need be come back to the topic latter.  </p>
<p>6.<b> Confused respondents.</b> <br/>They may be confused by the topic or the phrasing of queries. Be prepared to handle them without embarrassing them or being hostile <br/>
Use a repeat question strategy in which you rephrase the query and ask it latter in the interview. 
 </p>
<p>7.<b> Talkative respondents.</b><br/> Some love to talk about anything, especially if they feel like a celebrity because of an interview or a broadcast situation, and it is difficult to shut them off or keep them on track.<br/> Resort to using moderately open or closed-ended queries to give him/her less verbal maneuverability.<br/> Use more obvious interruptions only as a last resort.<br/> Set the ground rules prior to the interview or by reminding the interviewee of the limitations of space or time  </p>
