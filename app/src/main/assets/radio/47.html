<h2>WRITING FOR BROADCAST MEDIA</h2>

<h3>Characteristics of Broadcast Writing</h3>
<p><i>Broadcast journalism uses the  five Cs: Correctness, Clarity, Conciseness, Colour and conversational style.</i></p>

<p>1.	Correctness or Accuracy.<br/> Everything a broadcast journalist does must contribute to the telling of an accurate story.</p>
<p>2.	Clarity.<br/> Good broadcast writers employ clear, precise language that contains no ambiguity. Listeners and viewers cannot go back and re-hear news broadcast as they might be able to read a newspaper account more than once. They must understand what is said the first time.  They also achieve clarity by thoroughly knowing and understanding their subject.</p>
<p>3.	Conciseness.<br/> This is critical due to time constraints hence tight phrasing. A number of strategies are used to attain conciseness. 
	<p>(i) Elimination of all but most necessary adjectives and adverbs. Broadcasters know that their stories are built on nouns and passive voice. Instead they rely on strong, active verbs that will allow the listener to form a picture of the story.</p> 
	<p>(ii) Use of short, simple sentences.</p> 
<p>4.	Colour.<br/> This refers to writing that allows the listener to paint a picture of the story or event such as the inclusion of pertinent and insightful details in the story allowing the personality of the writer or news reader to come through in a story.<br/> Color is provided by observing and paying attention close attention to details, and using those details in your copy.</p>
<p>5.	Conversational style.<br/> Even the clearest, simplest newspaper style tends to sound stilted when it is read aloud.<br/> Broadcast writing must sound conversational because people will be reading it aloud.  Broadcast news should be written for the ear, not  the eye. The writer should keep in mind that someone is going to say the words and others will listen to them. <br/>This causal or conversational style, however, does not give the writer the freedom to break rules of grammar, to use slang or off-color phrasing or to use language that  might be offensive to listeners. The broadcast writer should try to focus attention on the content of the writing and not the writing itself.</p>
<p>6.	Immediacy.<br/> Another important characteristic of broadcast writing is emphasis on the immediate. While past tense verbs are preferred in the print media, broadcasters use the present tense as much as possible</p>

<h3>Story Structure for broadcast news</h3>
<p>The most common structure for broadcast news is called dramatic unity.  This structure  has three parts, namely:  climax, cause and effect.</p> 
<p><b>a)	Climax.</b> The climax of the story gives the listener the point in the story in about the same way as a lead in a print news story does; it tells the listener what happened. </p>
<p><b>b)	Cause.</b>The cause part of the story tells why it happened-the circumstances surrounding the event.</p>
<p><b>c)	Effect.</b>The effect portion of the story gives the listener the context of the story and possible some insight about what the story means.</p> 

<p>The following two examples demonstrate the dramatic unity story structure:</p>
<p>Example 1	</p>

<p>Climax:  Business owners in Eldoret Municipality will be paying an average of  3,000 Kenya Shillings more for their business permits next financial  year.</p>

<p>Cause: The municipal council   general meeting defeated several delaying amendments this afternoon and passed the   town clerk’s controversial revenue-raising  motion by a 15 to 14 vote. The motion  had been the subject of intense debate for more than a week.</p>

<p>Effect:  The motion now goes to the minister 
for local government for approval. Estimates 
are that the measure will raise about 40 
million Kenya shillings in new revenue  for the 
municipality next financial year. Primary and 
secondary shools will get most of that money. 
Passage of the motion is a major victory for 
the town clerk and his education program.</p>

<p>Example 2</p>
	<p>Climax:  Many children in public schools in Nairobi will begin their classes at least a half an hour later next year.</p>

<p>Cause: The  City School Board last night voted to rearrange the school bus schedule for next year as a cost-cutting measure.</p>

<p>Effect:  The new schedule will require most  primary school children to begin school one half later than they do now. Most secondary school  students will begin one half hour earlier.</p>



<h3>Writing for the Ear (radio)</h3>
<p>Writing for radio follows a distinct set of rules that must be followed if the broadcast is to be effective and professional.</p>
<p>1.	Use proper format: Format requirements vary by radio station, but in general, scripts should be in all caps and double spaced. Information should also be provided on sound cuts, including speaker, the type of cut (actuality, wrap, voicer), length, and outcue.</p>
<p>2.	Write conversationally: Radio scripts should be akin to normal speaking style. This varies dramatically from written writing, as material written for print tends to be more formal. In short, write as though you are telling the story to a friend.</p>
<p>3.	Use word economy: Do not use ten words if the message can be effectively conveyed using five.</p>
<p>4.	Use present tense: With news radio, the emphasis is on what is happening. Therefore, all scripts should be written in present tense.
Use up-to-date tenses</p>
<p>The single greatest advantage of broadcasting is immediacy. You can inform your listener as an event is happening, or immediately afterwards, without waiting for typesetters or printing presses.</p><p> Do not waste that advantage.</p>
<p>Keep all tenses as up-to-date as possible. Use the present tense or the tense nearest to the present and, whenever possible, use a continuous tense to tell your listener that a thing is still happening, as they listen.</p>
<p>Right:</p>  
<p>The Prime Minister says he expects an increase in imports this year.</p>   	<p>Wrong:</p>               
<p>The Prime Minister said he expected an increase in imports this year. 
</p><p>Right:</p>
<p>Leaders of the main opposition parties in Fiji have been meeting.</p>    	<p>Wrong:     </p><p>          
Leaders of the main opposition parties in Fiji met over the weekend</p><p>
Compare the tenses in the following examples. The verbs are in italics.
There is no room for words such as "yesterday", "last week" or "last Monday" in the intro of a broadcast news story. If the date makes the story seem old or stale, hide it down in the main body of the story.</p>
<p>5.	Use short sentences: Spoken language is comprised of brief sentences, and material written for radio should reflect that. Providing the radio anchor with short sentences will also help with delivery, as it’s difficult to anticipate the direction of a long, run-on sentence.</p>
<p>6.	Use dashes for acronyms that are spelled out: In the case of “AIDS,” you would write “AIDS,” because this is how it’s spoken. But if an acronym is spelled out, as in the case of CBS, it should be written “C-B-S.”</p>
<p>7.	Note network affiliation: When utilizing reporter- or network-generated sound cuts, always note the network affiliation.</p>
<p>8.	Don’t be repetitive: When writing around sound cuts in the case of a reporter- or anchor-read wrap, do not repeat information that’s mentioned in the cut. This redundancy is a waste of airtime. Instead, the lead-in should serve as an introduction to what the listeners can expect to hear.</p>
<p>9.	Avoid clichés or “groaners:” These phrases can be very distracting and void of meaning. And when the listener is distracted by a cliché, his attention is no longer focused on the story.<p/>
<p>10.	Provide pronunciation guides. In the case of uncommon or difficult-to-pronounce names, provide a notation on pronunciation following every instance of the name.</p>
<p>11.	Avoid “he/she” ambiguity: When referencing more than one individual in a script, always reference that person by name or title. Utilizing “he” or “she” can be confusing, particularly when there’s multiple individuals referenced in the story.</p>
<p>12.	Ensure clarity and flow: A story that’s clear in the form of a newspaper article may not be clear when spoken aloud on the air. When written, a story may also have a nice flow, but that flow is not conversational. So read all scripts aloud prior to submission.</p>
<p>13.	Only mention what’s necessary: Lengthy, detail-inclusive stories should be left to the newspapers. News radio serves to provide only the most vital facts in a story. Including unnecessary information will waste valuable airtime and bore listeners.</p>
<p>14.	Do not include ages: Many writers are inclined to include the ages of individuals involved in crimes and other similar stories. But unless there is something highly relevant and remarkable about the individual’s age (i.e. an 11-year-old murderer), it should be omitted. One exception is in the case of the description of a suspect sought by police. In this instance, the person’s age is vital to a citizen’s ability to identify the individual.</p>
<p>15.	Estimate when it comes to numbers: Do not mention “193 students.” Instead, mention, “nearly 200 students.” Exact numbers are not going to be comprehended by the listener.</p>
<p>16.	Write out numbers one through ten: With numbers over ten, they should be entered numerically.<p>
<p>17.	Downplay unconfirmed facts or unknown information: Credibility is harmed when an anchor begins a story by mentioning the information that the station doesn’t yet have. Instead of beginning a story by saying, “Police have not released any information in this case,” mention what is known. Then conclude with, “Additional information is expected soon,” only if it’s vital information that the listeners should not be without.</p>

<h3>Writing for the Eye (television)</h3>
<p>1.	Keep It Simple. <br/> Newspaper reporters wanting to show off their writing style occasionally insert a fancy word into a story. But that just doesn't work in broadcast news writing. Broadcast copy must be as simple as possible. Remember, viewers aren't reading what you're writing, they're hearing it. People watching TV or listening to the radio generally don't have time to check a dictionary. So keep your sentences simple and use basic, easily understood words. If you find you've put a longish word in a sentence, replace it with a shorter one. </p><p>Example:</p>
<p>•	Print:The physician conducted an extensive autopsy on the decedent.</p>
<p>•	Broadcast:The doctor did an autopsy on the body.</p>
<p>2.	Keep It Short.<br/> Generally, sentences in broadcast copy should be even shorter than those found in print articles. Why? Shorter sentences are more easily understood than long ones. Also, remember that broadcast copy must be read out loud. If you write a sentence that's too long, the news anchor will be gasping for breath just to finish it. Individual sentences in broadcast copy should be short enough to be easily read in one breath. </p><p>Example: </p>
<p>•	Print: President Barrack Obama and congressional Democrats sought to ease Republican complaints about a massive economic stimulus plan Friday, meeting with GOP (Grand Old Party) leaders in the White House and promising to consider some of their recommendations.</p>
<p>•	Broadcast: President Barrack Obama met with Republican leaders in Congress today. The Republicans aren't happy with Obama's big economic stimulus plan. Obama says he'll consider their ideas.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>KISS</b></p>
<p>Keep it short and simple. You should not try to get too much information into any sentence. Although you use the inverted pyramid style of story writing, you may only be able to use one or two concepts (ideas) per sentence. You cannot get as much detail into a radio or television story as you can into a newspaper story.</p><p>
You cannot expect your listener to understand the Who? What? Where? When? Why? and How? of a story all in the first paragraph or even the first two paragraphs. Although as a good journalist you should not leave any essential questions unanswered, you may find that it takes all the time available for a single story to communicate only a few basic facts. It is often said that you could put all the words in a ten minute radio bulletin on one page of a newspaper.</p><p>
Stick to one or two key points per sentence. No sentence should be longer than 20 words, except in unusual circumstances. Just as a mother feeds a child one spoonful at a time, allowing the child to swallow each spoonful before taking the next, you should spoon feed your listener. Give them one piece of information at a time so that it can be digested before the next piece.</p><p>
Where necessary, split a long and involved sentence into two or more shorter clearer sentences, as you would in conversation.</p>
<p>Right: </p>
<p>Japanese boats have returned to fish in Fijian waters.                

They were banned last year because of an international row over net sizes.        

Now they are back in the waters off Vanua Levu. 
</p><p>   
  	Wrong:</p><p>
 	Japanese fishing boats, which were banned from Fijian waters during an international row over net sizes last year, returned to fish in the waters off Vanua Levu on Monday.</p>
	
<p>It may take more words, but what good is the most skilful sentence in history if the listener cannot understand it?</p><p>
It might help you to write short and simple sentences if you first try to imagine how the story might appear in a newspaper headline.</p><p>
Once you have reduced it to the bones of a headline, you can put some flesh on it for radio and television. Don't forget though that, whereas newspaper headlines can be incomplete sentences, without words like the and a, radio and television news must be in complete sentences.</p><p>
Look at the following example and notice how we take the details in the information, strip it down to the bones by writing a headline, then add words to turn the headline into a complete sentence, suitable for radio or television.</p><p>
Information:</p><p>
A contract for the construction of a new road between Madang and Lae has been awarded to a Korean company.</p>
<p>Headline:</p><p>
Koreans to build new road</p><p>
Intro:</p><p>
A Korean company is to build a new road between Madang and Lae.</p><p>
3.	Keep It Conversational. Many sentences found in newspaper stories simply sound stilted and unwieldy when read out loud. So use a conversational style in your broadcast writing. Doing so will make it sound more like real speech, as opposed to a script someone is reading. Example: </p>
<p>•	Print: Pope Benedict XVI joined U.S. President Barrack Obama and Queen Elizabeth II on Friday by launching his own YouTube channel, the latest Vatican effort to reach out to the digital generation.</p><p>
•	Broadcast: President Obama has a YouTube channel. So does Queen Elizabeth. Now Pope Benedict has one too. The Pope wants to use the new channel to reach out to young people.</p><p>
4.	Use One Main Idea per Sentence. Sentences in newspaper stories sometimes contain several ideas, usually in clauses that are broken up by commas. But in broadcast writing you really shouldn't put more than one main idea in each sentence. Why not? You guessed it - more than one main idea per sentence and that sentence will be too long. Example:</p><p>
•	Print: Gov. David Paterson appointed Democratic U.S. Rep. Kirsten Gellibrand on Friday to fill New York's vacant Senate seat, finally settling on a woman from a largely rural, eastern district of the state to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p><p>
•	Broadcast: Gov. David Paterson has appointed Democratic Congresswoman Kirsten Gellibrand to fill New York's vacant Senate seat. Gellibrand is from a rural part of the state. She will replace Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p><p>
5.	Use the Active Voice. Sentences written in the active voice just naturally tend to be shorter and more to the point than those written in the passive voice. Example: </p><p>
•	Passive: The robbers were arrested by police.</p><p>
•	Active: Police arrested the robbers.</p><p>
6.	Use a Lead-in Sentence. Most broadcast news stories start with a lead-in sentence that is fairly general. Broadcast news writers do this to alert viewers that a new story is being presented, and to prepare them for the information that is to follow. <br/>Example: </p><p>
•	"There's more bad news today from Iraq." Note that this sentence doesn't say very much. But again, it lets the viewer know that the next story is going to be about Iraq.</p> <p>The lead-in sentence almost serves as a kind of headline for the story. Here's an example of a broadcast news item. Note the use of a lead-in line, short, simple sentences and a conversational style.</p> 
<p>There's more bad news from Iraq. Four U.S. soldiers were killed in an ambush outside Baghdad today. The Pentagon says the soldiers were hunting insurgents when their Humvee came under sniper fire. The Pentagon hasn't yet released the soldiers' names.</p>
<p>7.	Put Attribution at the Start of the Sentence. Print news stories usually put the attribution, the source of the information, at the end of the sentence. In broadcast news writing we put them at the beginning. Example:</p>
<p>•	Print: Two men were arrested, police said.</p>
<p>•	Broadcast: Police say two men were arrested.</p>
<p>Put attribution first</p><p>
Attribution in radio and television goes at the front of a sentence, as it would if you were talking to that favourite aunt. </p><p>This is unlike traditional newspaper style, which commonly puts attribution such as he said at the end of the sentence, after the quote. </p><p>In newspapers, readers can see both the quote and the attribution together.</p><p> In radio and television, your listeners need to know who was speaking before they can judge what was said. </p><p>Remember the linear structure of broadcast news. </p><p>
Compare the following sentences. The attribution is in italics.</p>
<p>Right:</p> <p>
A senior government economist says that people in Papua New Guinea are paid too much.
</p>	<p>Wrong:</p><p>
People are paid too much in Papua New Guinea, a senior government economist said last night.  </p><p>
By putting the attribution up front, you are also making your sentence more active, important for broadcast news.</p><p>
8.	Leave Out Unnecessary Details. Print stories tend to include a lot of details that we just don't have time for in broadcast. Example:</p><p>
•	Print: After robbing the bank the man drove approximately 9.7 miles before being apprehended, police said.</p><p>
•	Broadcast: Police say the man robbed the bank then drove nearly 10 miles before he was caught. </p><p>

The broadcast news lead may be short on facts, but if it captures the attention of the reader, it has served its purpose for example: </p><p>
The lame duck keeps limping along. The cabinet met for the third week of its  weekly Thurdsday meetings today, and again they  failed to agree on  the draft bill to set up a local tribunal. </p><p>

The first sentence has very little of facts, but it gets the listener into the story. This  type  of story 
structure is only appropriate for certain stories, however. 
</p><p>
If the facts of the story are strong enough to gain the listener’s attention, they should be  used to open the story e.g. </p><p>

The five-cents-a-gallon gas tax is now law. President Barrack Obama  signed the bill authorizing the tax today while vacationing in Chicago.</p>

Writing Proposals for Radio and TV Programs 
A proposal is a document that reveals all the fundamental details in their exact terms as intended for   radio or TV production.  It is prepared by a producer.  It seeks to answer the 5Ws and H. A good proposal should have the following elements:
i)	What. What is the program about? What are the reasons why that program is important to the target audience? What gaps will it fill?
ii)	Who are the characters and who are the target audience?
iii)	When. Period of preparing and broadcasting the program
iv)	Where. In which regions do you propose the program?
v)	How. In what format do you want the program prepared and broadcasted?

A program proposal serves various functions:
i)	It serves a  guide to the process of production
ii)	For planning of resources
iii)	Used to justify the relevance, and significance of a proposed program for outsourcing of funds to support  production
iv)	The proposal is written after one has conceptualized an idea for a program to a given target audience.
Program Production Proposal
Writing the program proposal
A program proposal is a written document that stipulates what you intend to do. It briefly explains the program objectives and the major aspects of the presentation. It should include the following information:
1.	A working title: keep the title short and memorable
2.	Program objective: This brief explanation of what the production is to accomplish. The objectives refer (objective should apply to the audience) to the audience and answer the question- what change does the program hope to bring about in the audiences knowledge, attitudes and practices? These objectives should be measureable and stated as precisely as possible. They should be specific, measureable, appropriate, realistic, and time bound (SMART)
3.	Target Audience (TA):  the target audience is who you would primarily like t have watch the show. You should clearly define the target audience in terms of demographics such as gender, age, ethnicity, education, income level, geographical  location (urban or rural) as well as religious preferences, as well as psychographics such as consumer buying habits, values and lifestyle.
It is also necessary to know where the audience stands with regard to the desired behavior change.
4.	Justification: justify the importance of the program economically and what effect the program has to the target audience. You justify the program by:
•	defending the content and target audience
•	defending the chosen medium and format
•	justifying the transmission time (TX time)
Because every communication medium has its strengths and weaknesses, the design team needs to be clear about its reasons for choosing a particular medium. E.g., one major reason for choosing radio is that it has the greatest reach in rural areas. It is also less expensive to produce radio drama than TV drama and radio can reach an illiterate audience that could not take advantage of print materials. Alternatively television might be chosen in city and pre urban areas because it attracts greater attention than radio or print. Reasons why the program should have relevance, interest and impact for the intended audience
5.	Synopsis: Summary of the program. The outline story in brief or a summary of the main elements and the angle you intend to take in treating them.
6.	Production method: indicate 
•	whether it is a multiple or single camera production
•	is the program shot for live transmission or shot for post production
•	materials and equipment needed for the production
•	Members of the production team.
7.	Tentative budget: Before preparing the tentative budget, you must have up to date figures for all production services, rental costs and wages in your area. When working for a client you need to prepare a budget for all preproduction, production and post production costs. You need to figure the cost not only for obvious items-scripts, talent, production personnel, studio and equipment rental and post production editing- but also for items that may not be so apparent, such as videotape, certain props, food, lodging, transportation, entertainment and clearance or user fees for location shooting.

Scripting for Radio and TV Programs


Script writing is the activity of creating a script for any person or people to perform. Though it is most often associated with the movie and television industries, script writing is also an important part of live theatre, news casting, advertising, sales and education.

The script is what makes sense of the information you have gathered. It is the framework for your story. It brings together the most important elements, and helps your audience understand the significance of the points the people you have interviewed have made.

Why Do We Script- by Alwyn Owen and Jack Perkins
•	To introduce and/or end an item or programme
•	To link sections of a programme
•	To convey information that is not available in recorded form, or which can be more logically or succinctly conveyed by a narrator
•	To give a programme editorial direction so that somebody can be heard to be controlling the flow of information.
•	To introduce mood or feeling into a programme, or to set a scene
•	To tell a complete story as in a feature programme To introduce and/or end an item or programme
•	To link sections of a programme
•	To convey information that is not available in recorded form, or which can be more logically or succinctly conveyed by a narrator
•	To give a programme editorial direction so that somebody can be heard to be controlling the flow of information.
•	To introduce mood or feeling into a programme, or to set a scene
•	To tell a complete story as in a feature programme

Scripting is an important process in  radio and TV program’s/news  production  due to the  following reasons:
i)	Removes stress in broadcasting
ii)	Ensures nothing is left out if it is important
iii)	Enables the journalist to communicate the thoughts of others properly
iv)	For a good flow of program
v)	Gives permanent form  to the transient nature of speech
vi)	Reference in future especially in legal suits.
vii)	To ensure quality program presentation
viii)	For proper use of broadcast time.


Stages  in Program Production
Program production can be divided into three stages especially for the recorded ones. These stages are:
1.	Pre-production. Zettl (2009) says that preproduction includes all the preparations and activities before you actually move into the studio or field on the first day of production. It usually occurs in two stages: (a) stage 1 consists of all the activities necessary to transform the basic idea into workable concept or script (b) in stage 2 all the necessary production details such as location, crews, and the necessary equipment for single-camera or multi-camera production are worked out. 

Preproduction involves program proposal, synopsis, scripts, production schedules, budgets and storyboards. Program proposal is a written document that outlines the process message and the major aspects of a TV/radio presentation. Synopsis is a short paragraph that describes the basic story line. Scripts   are complete production guides on paper specifying what will be seen or heard in the finished product. A budget describes how funds will be spent in each production category.  A storyboard provides a graphic visualization of important shots that will be recorded.

2.	Production. Production involves equipment and normally a crew-people who operate the equipment. I t includes all activities in which an event is video recorded or televised (Zettl, 2009). Production involves set-up and rehearsals. This involves rehearsing scenes in preparation for the actual recording. It is charting the movement of talents on set which is known as performers’ blocking.  Every camera movement of the camera is called camera blocking.  Every camera movement and placement must be carefully worked out prior to recording. Production also entails selection, visuals, casting, graphics etc.

3.	Postproduction. Zettl (2009) says that postproduction consists of video and audio editing. It may also include colour correction of the various video clips (so that the red shirt of an actor looks the same from one shot to the next), the selection of appropriate background music, and the creation of special audio effects. Postproduction begins after visuals and sounds have been recorded. It includes editing of soundtracks and use of effects. It involves balancing and controlling audio and video. It involves picking the best video takes and combines the various tracks into one. 



TOPIC FIVE
RADIO AND TV NEWS PRESENTATION

The following are the different types of news programs for radio and TV:
1.	News Bulletin/Bulletin/News in Brief.  News for a few minutes e.g. mostly 3- 5 minutes. They give important news hourly, rarely use actualities. Individual items are short up to 30 seconds. It can include the breaking news. 
2.	News Program.  They are detailed, have more items and variety of issues, length of stories vary with the duration of the newscast, importance of the story, and availability of news. It can be 20-60 minutes. Items are more sophisticated and may use actualities, stills and graphics. The program has a clear identity, greater balance and variety of material. Some shorter stories may be included to give breadth to the coverage.
3.	News Analysis.  Where news items are presented and analyzed during the presentation.
4.	News Roundup.   Summary of the major news covered over a long period of time e.g. a week, such as Dunia Wiki Hii. 
5.	24 Hour News Program.  Round the clock coverage via satellite. The format of presentation can be magazine approach where a variety of programs  e.g. phone-in or discussions and personalities are presented throughout the day amidst regular bulletins or news cycles where repeats and updates on  extended news bulletin take place. In news cycle there is constant update of hard news  stories e.g. having one hour national news, another one hour for local news, traffic, sport, weather, finance, etc. K24.
6.	Documentaries/Features.  Deal with topical issue or subject in detail. Does not rely on a news peg. Usually last for about 20-60 minutes for documentary and about seven minutes for a feature. Covers a single theme or few issues. Jicho Pevu.
7.	Verite. It is a presentation technique that edits out questions and links various interviews and actualities to look as if no reporter was present. No narration. It requires great skillful set up and manipulation to get the interviewee to tell the story without using the narration. Gumzo Mtaani. Niko Base.
8.	Breaking news/News Flashes. This is a current event that broadcasters feel warrants the interruption of scheduled programming and/or current news in order to report its details. Many times, breaking news is used after the news network has already reported on this story. When a story has not been reported on previously, the graphic and phrase Just In is sometimes used instead. Its use is often loosely assigned to the most significant story of the moment or a story that is being covered live. It could be a story that is simply of wide interest to viewers and has little impact otherwise.
 

Factors  that Influence the Selection of a  Copy in Broadcast Journalism
1.	News values such as impact, timeliness, prominence, proximity, drama and human interest. A copy with most or all of these values is more newsworthy hence it can be selected.
2.	News hole. The amount of space in a newspaper or broadcast news show that remains for journalism after advertising has been placed; the amount of content a news provider needs to create in every publishing cycle. The size of the broadcast time that is allocated after all ads/commercials have been included.
3.	Peer/competition pressure. Media houses may bring some items just because other media have them e.g. exclusive interviews.
4.	Ruling elites/Political influence. Powerful politicians and those with economic power tend to make their stories into air. During elections campaigns this is clearly demonstrated.
5.	Advertisers. Media finds it hard to write negatively about advertisers especially if it may the cost the organization highly.
6.	Owner’s influence. Owners’ interests define what is covered in the media.
7.	Editorial policies. Each media house has specifications of the type of stories that they can air.
8.	Ethical and legal standards. Is it fair to present this story on radio/TV? Naked scenes, bloody scenes etc. ethically it is not good to show a dead person’s face. The law can also lead to censorship (defamation).

News Presentation

  News can be  presented as scripted or as adlip  for example in interview or eye reporting. Some considerations are:
1.	Emphasis.  This gives increased importance. This can be done through: 
•	Volume- not shouting but using more volume.
•	Pausing-change of rate to arouse interest. Silence is effective and gets attention of the audience.
•	Pitch/intonation but being natural.
2.	Speed. Words should be easy and simple for the presenter to say them fast. Words can be easily misheard or misunderstood. The speed of reading 3 words per second, 150 words per minute (125-150-180 words per minute).
3.	Story order.
4.	Using autocue
5.	Story formats. News story formats can be summed up as follows:
a)	Live. Reporter goes live from the scene and events are shown as they unfold. It is used for important stories. The strength of the station’s signal is important.
b)	Package.  This is a self-contained taped report put together by the reporter. It includes sound, video, etc.
c)	Interview.  Also called Sound On Tape (SOT), sound bite or actuality. This is 10-20 second interview segment with a person who is connected to the news.
d)	Phoner. A live report phoned in by the reporter at the scene of the story. Suitable for breaking news, on short deadlines or where it is impossible to provide video.
e)	Reader.  The news anchor reads a story on air with no supporting audio or video element. Used for least important stories or news reported on minute.

6.	News hole. A producer has to consult the program log for the day to find out how much commercial time has been sold for the newscast. The traffic department is in charge of scheduling programs and commercials to ensure there is no conflict between the stories on air and the content of the commercials set to run during the newscast.

The news hole is 10 minutes and 40 second. 30 seconds have been added into the breaks, the transition of going into ad out of every break will take about 5 seconds. Weather and spports each have 3 minutes 30 seconds for the entire block but they can ‘donate’ time from their blocks to the news hole. The close is the credit rolling off the screen. Most pads take 30 seconds or more incase some items run longer than anticipated.
7.	Rundown/Running Order.This is an outline that allows a producer to edit, switch or eliminate stories within a newscast. It should be flexible to accommodate change even during the broadcast. The copy of the rundown is used by all people involved in news. It is prepared by the producer. All use it for different reasons: technical staff use it decide what tape to run and in what order; anchors use it when they are reading news;  audio staff use it to decide when to open and close  microphones.

The style of rundown vary but certain information is vital . All must show:
a)	Story slug- the name of the story in brief e.g. abbreviate one or two word description of the story e.g. STORM. This is in capital letters.
b)	Talent- this refers to the anchor who will read the story on air. This can be seen by initials or camera numbers.
c)	Format- how the story will be presented on air e.g. V/O, live, etc.
d)	Tape on- if there a tape connected with the story it will be assigned a number. However, the use of digital computer files has reduced the human error of markup tapes.
e)	ERT (Estimated Running Time) - how long the story will run. If there is no tape then it is a measure of how long it will take the anchor to read the story.
f)	Tape- if there is a tape, the duration is indicated.
g)	Total- the ERT and tape gives the total time of the story. If a story runs slow and takes long i.e. running heavy, the producer can eliminate certain stories in the rundown but if the show seems to move quickly and under the allotted time-running right, the producer can add stories or let the anchors know to adjust their reading speed. Run time show hoe the stories  are timing out

8.	Building Rapport with the audience
a)	Don’t read, tell  a story
b)	Look at the mass audience as an individual whom you are telling a story
c)	Put your expressions, that’s, lips, hands, face, into your voice
d)	Have the energy  and tone that easily commands listenership
e)	Know your script. Re-read it before transmission to be familiar with names, punctuations, etc.
f)	If possible, re-write stories to suit your voice. Think before you speak
g)	Relax and have quiet time after rehearsing for the  presentation
h)	Prepare ad lips. This is a script that indicates the back announcements, station’s slogans, comments or even time. This will help one not to stumble over words.
i)	If things go wrong, stay composed, but recover swiftly
j)	Avoid dead air, but if this happens apologize and continue. This is common due to technical errors e.g. in running an insert. If after a few seconds the error is rectified, reintroduce the story
k)	If you read a word wrongly, repeat quickly if need be but if the error is minor, let it go
l)	Avoid clinches, like “  I am sorry, I’ll read that again”
m)	Avoid corpsing on air i.e. dry-up, busting into laughter. This shows nervousness and panic. The audience will loose confidence in you.
n)	If tired or weary, take black coffee without sugar or water with a lemon twist before presentation
o)	Dress for your audience































TOPIC SIX
TECHNOLOGIES IN RADIO AND TV NEWS COVERAGE AND PRESENTATION 

EQUIPMENT FOR AUDIO AND VIDEO PRODUCTION
Each piece of equipment in the studio can perform one or seven basic control functions. They are designed to move, modify or control a signal in these seven ways:
1.	Transducing: (converting sound waves into electrical energy and back again). The entire process by which sound is converted into broadcast signal is referred to as transducing.  
2.	Channeling: sending the signal or routing the signal wherever necessary (read on patch bay.)
3.	Mixing: The primary function of the audio console/mixer is that of combining and blending different sources into a balanced whole.
4.	Shaping: Altering the tonal qualities of the sound. E.g. using filters to eliminate high or low frequency tones or pitches and overtones.
5.	Amplifying: The signal from a microphone is relatively weak and must be strengthened before it can be mixed with other signals that have been amplified.
6.	Recording and/or playing: 
7.	Monitoring

RECORDING EQUIPMENT FOR AUDIO (SOUND)
The major components of audio equipment are the audio console, the patch bay and analog and digital tape based and tapeless audio recording systems.
i.	MICROPHONES
Microphones convert sound into an electrical signal that varies in relation to the sounds picked up by the mic. All microphones have a diaphragm which vibrates with the sound pressure and a sound generating element which changes the physical vibrations of the diaphragm into electric energy. 


Types of microphones
•	Dynamic/moving coil microphones: it is a microphone whose sound pickup devise consists of a diaphragm that is attached to a movable coil. As the diaphragm vibrates with the air pressure from the sound the coil moves within a magnetic field, generating an electric current. 
They can be worked close to the source and still withstand high sound levels without damage to the microphone or excessive input overload (distortion of very high volume sounds). Dynamic mikes are ideal for outdoor use. They can also withstand fairly extreme temperatures. There are two types of moving coil microphones. Some pick up sound all around. These are omni directional. Others pick up from in front of the microphone only. These are unidirectional. Their pick up pattern is known as cardioid.
•	Condenser/capacitor microphones: a microphone whose diaphragm consists of a condenser plate that vibrates with the sound pressure against another fixed condenser plate called the backplate. Also called the capacitor microphone. Compared with dynamic microphone, condenser microphones are much more sensitive to physical shock, temperature change and input overload, but they usually produce high quality sound when used at greater distance from the sound source. Because the capacitor generates a very low level signal, it needs a preamplifier; this requires a battery power source either within the mike itself or very near to it.
•	Ribbon microphones: a microphone whose sound pick up devise consists of a ribbon that vibrates with the sound pressures within a magnetic field. Unlike condenser mics, which you may use outdoors, ribbon mics are strictly for indoor use. Ribbon mics are bi directional. They respond in a figure of eight, picking up sound from both sides. They are often used to record studio interviews or discussions and they are placed on a stand or suspended on ceiling. An example of ribbon mic is the lip mike that is held against the mouth.
1.	Pickup patterns
Microphones are classed by their pick up pattern, or polar patter, which refers to how a mic picks up sound from different directions in relation to where the mic is pointing.
Whereas some microphones, like our ears hear sounds from all directions equally well, others hear sounds better when they come from a specific direction. The territory within which a microphone can hear equally well is called its pick up pattern (the area within which the microphone can accurately pick up sound.)
The Omni directional microphones hear sound from all directions more or less equally well. They are useful for picking up the general sound, the ambience of a scene or location.
The quality of the audio pick up is determined by the distance of the source to the microphone-not by the direction of this source from the mic. 
The unidirectional microphone hears better in one direction- the front of the mic-than from its sides or the back. Because the polar patterns of unidirectional microphones are roughly heart shaped, they are called cardioid. Long distance microphones or shotgun microphones operate with this sort of pattern structure. To further increase their sensitivity, they are sometimes used in conjunction with a parabolic dish, which can collect and concentrate a relatively distant audio source and reflect this focused audio beam directly into the microphone.
The bidirectional mic accepts sound from the front and rear and rejects it from the sides.
This was a desired feature in radio drama and interview because the speakers and actors could stand on either side of the microphone facing each other while speaking. The bidirectional pattern is typical of ribbon mics that have the ribbon open to air on both sides. 
The supercardioid, hypercardioid and ultrcardioid microphones have progressively narrower pickup patterns, which mean that their hearing is more and more concentrated in the front. Their claim to fame is that they can hear sounds from far away and make them appear to be relatively close. These mics also hear sounds that are in the back of them but because they excel on hearing in one direction, they still belong to the unidirectional group.
ii.	AUDIO CONSOLE
Regardless of individual designs analog or digital- all audio consoles or audio control boards are built to perform five major functions
Input: To preamplify and control the volume of the various incoming signals. Studio consoles have multiple inputs to accept a variety of sound sources. 
Each input module requires that you select either the mic or the line input. The mic level inputs are for sound sources that need to be preamplified before they are sent to the various input controls. All microphones need such preamplification and are therefore routed to the mic input.
Line level inputs such as CD players, DVD players have a strong enough signal to be routed to the line input without preamplification. All incoming audio signals must reach line level strength before they can be further adjusted or mixed at the audio console.
Mix: To combine and balance two or more incoming signals. The audio console lets you combine or mix the signals from various inputs. The mix bus combines these various audio signals with the specific signal that you assign.
Quality Control: All audio consoles have various controls that let you shape the character of a sound. Among the most important are equalization, filters and reverberation controls.
The process of controlling the audio signal by emphasizing certain frequencies and de emphasizing or eliminating others is called equalization. Filters eliminate automatically all frequencies above or below a certain point. The reverb controls can be add an increasing amount of reverberation to each of the selected inputs
Output: The mixed and quality processed signal is then routed to the output called the line out. To ensure that the mixed signals stay within the acceptable volume limits, they are regulated by final volume indicators, the most common of which is the volume unit.
Monitor: to listen to the sound before or as their signals are actually recorded or broadcast.

iii.	PATCH BAY
The primary function of the patch bay or patch panel is connecting and routing audio signals to and from various pieces of equipment. You can accomplish this by using actual wires that establish specific connections or with a computer that rearranges the signals and sends them according to your instructions.

iv.	ANALOG AND DIGITAL TAPE BASED AND TAPELESS AUDIO RECORDING SYSTEMS.
All analog recording systems are tape based they include:
i.	Open-reel audio tape recorder (reel to reel recorder) and 
ii.	Audio cassette recorder.
Tapeless recording systems include
iii.	Digital cart system
iv.	Mini discs and flash memory devices
v.	Hard drives
vi.	CD and DVD players

v.	AUDIO MONITOR
Also called the program speaker. The audio monitor fulfills a function for audio similar to what the studio monitors do for a video.
EQUIPMENT FOR VIDEO PRODUCTION
A video production shoot requires appropriate equipment to get the best possible audio and video quality for your project. Your equipment needs will vary depending upon an indoor or outdoor shoot, sound quality of the environment you are shooting and what type of video you are producing. However, the following basic pieces of equipment are always necessary to provide quality video, sound and lighting for an interview, news story or commercial shoot.
1. CAMERA
The camera is designed to convert the optical image as projected by the lens into an electrical signal- video signal. The major conversion element is the imaging devise, a small electronic chip called the CCD (charge coupled device.). It responds to light in a manner that resembles a light meter. When the CCD receives a large amount of light, it produces a strong video signal; when it receives faint light, it produces a weak signal.
Cameras fall into four groups (based on their production function)
•	Studio cameras: They are used for various studio productions such as news, interviews and panel shows and for daily serial dramas. The difference between the studio camera and the ENG/EFP and consumer cameras is the studio camera can function only as part of the camera chain; all other camera types can be self-contained. Capable of delivering a video signal to a recording devise without any peripheral devise.
The picture quality of a studio camera is determined by the Video Operator (VO) who is operating the CCU (camera control unit).They are so heavy they cannot be maneuvered properly without the aid of a pedestal.
•	ENG/EFP cameras and camcorders (Electronic News Gathering/ Electronic Field Production): They are portable. Can be carried by camera operator or put on a tripod. They are also self contained and hold the entire camera chain in the camera head.
•	Consumer camcorders: most consumers have a single chip imaging devise and a built in VTR. All have automated features such as auto focus, auto iris. In addition to the to the regular eyepiece viewfinder, most consumer camcorders have a fold out screen on which you can see the picture you are taking without having to hold the camera close to your eye.
•	Prosumer camcorders: The high definition video (HDV) captures video with three high quality imaging devices.
2. CAMERA CONTROL UNIT (CCU)
The CCU performs two main functions: setup and control. During setup each camera is adjusted for the correct color, rendition, the white balance (manipulating the three color signals so that they reproduce white correctly under a variety of lighting conditions.), the proper contrast range between the brightest and the darkest areas of scene and the brightness.
Controlling involves adjusting the camera for darkest part of the scene and adjusting the f stop of the lens so that it will permit only the desired amount of light to reach the image devise.
Most of the camera functions (framing, focus, etc) are controlled normally by a camera operator, whilst certain functions (color balance, shutter speed, etc) are controlled remotely by the CCU operator. This allows the camera operator to concentrate on framing and composition without being distracted by technical issues. At the same time the CCU operator, who is a specialist in the more technical issues, is concentrating on the quality and consistency of the pictures.
In a multi-camera production the CCU operator will usually be responsible for more than one camera (2-3 cameras are common, but up to 10 are possible). Obviously a large production may require a number of CCU operators. For example, a 20-camera broadcast could have 5 CCU operators, each controlling 4 cameras. 
The controls are relatively advanced and allow the CCU operator to:
•	Control the iris, shutter speed, black level, gain, etc.
•	Adjust color balances
•	Monitor and adjust a wide range of technical parameters
•	Send signals to the camera operator
3. VIDEO MONITORS (PREVIEW MONITOR & LINE MONITOR)
There is usually a preview monitor for each of the studio camera and separate preview monitors for videotape recorders, the C.G (Character Generator) and other special effect devices.  A preview monitor is used to look at camera picture or video effect before putting it on the program line out.
A line monitor is the master program monitor that displays the final program picture that is to be recorded or transmitted.
4. VIDEO SWITCHER/MIXER
A vision mixer (video switcher or production switcher) refers to either:
•	A device used to mix multiple video sources into one or more master outputs.
•	A person who operates a vision mixing device. 
Examples
 	The Panasonic AW-SW350 is a compact half-rack vision mixer with five Y/C and composite video inputs. This would be suitable for a small production studio or field production unit.
 	The Sony BVS-3200CP is a relatively small desk console suitable for a moderately-sized production unit or OB. 

What Does a Vision Mixer Do?
The main purpose of a vision mixer is to create a master output for a real-time video recording or broadcast. Typically vision mixers are used for live events or any event where multiple sources need to be mixed in real-time 
Vision mixers can also be used to create various visual effects, from simple mixes and wipes between sources to advanced composite effects.
How Does Vision Mixing Work?
Vision mixers are conceptually similar to audio mixers. They take multiple input sources, apply any desired effects or processing, and provide one or more outputs.
Most vision mixers are based around the preview bus and the program bus, each of which has its own monitor.
•	The program bus is the main output feed, i.e. the vision which is being recorded or broadcast. Whichever source is on the program bus is said to be online.
•	The preview bus is used to select and preview the source which is about to be put online.
Note: The preview bus does not have to be used — sources can be cut online without being previewing if desired. However the preview is normally necessary for any visual effects such as transitions, as the effect is constructed from the preview and program sources. 
The Role of Vision Switcher
The vision switcher takes their instruction from the director. Basically, the director decides what is going to happen and tells the switcher to do it. A typical set of instructions might go like this:
Director's Instruction: 	Meaning:
"1 next"	Preview camera 1 and prepare to put it online. 
"Take"	Cut camera 1 online.
"2 next"	Preview camera 2 and prepare to put it online.
"Mix"	Mix camera 2 online.  
etc etc 	 
Note: In some studios the director will say "cut" instead of "take". This is a potential source of confusion though, as "cut" is also used to mean "everyone stops
The switcher lets you select various video sources such as cameras, video tape and titles or other special effects and join them through a variety of transitions. The switcher allows you to do instantaneous editing. A switcher performs three functions:
•	select an appropriate video source from several inputs
•	perform basic transitions between two video sources
•	Create or retrieve special effects such as split screen.
The production switcher has several rows of buttons and other controls for selecting and mixing various video inputs and creating transitions and special effects. It then sends the selected video to the line out.
A simple switcher has the following:
Program bus: a row of buttons which sends everything you punch up to the directly to the line out (and from there to the transmitter or video recorder.) It is a direct input output link and therefore the line out.
Mix buses: If you want the switcher to do dissolve, fades, cuts and supers (double exposure of two images) you need two more buses the mix bus and a lever called the fader bar that controls the speed of the mix. A mix bus is added to the program bus so as to get the mix to the line out.
Preview bus: the preview bus is identical to the program bus in the number, type, and arrangement of buttons. The functions of the button are also similar, except that the line out of the preview monitor does not go to the air o for recording device but simply to a preview monitor.
4. VIDEOTAPE RECORDERS (VTR)
A video tape recorder is any electronic recording device that records video and audio signal on video tape for later playback or postproduction editing.
During video recording, the video tape moves past a rotating head assembly that writes the video and audio signal on the tape during the recording process and reads the magnetically stored information off the tape during playback.
Analog video tape recorders
The more popular analog VTRs in television stations and production centers in descending order of quality include:
•	Betacam Sp
•	S-VHS
•	VHS
Digital videotape recorders
•	DV  			
•	DVCAM
•	DVPRO		
•		Betacam SX	
•	HDTV			HDV



TOPIC SEVEN
   LAW IN RELATION TO MASS MEDIA PRACTICE AND ETHICS
•	Defamation
Defamation is any allegation or imputation of a fact which attacks the honor or the consideration of the person or of the body to which the fact is imputed. The law of defamation exists to protect reputation. Kenya’s defamation laws derive from English law in which every man is entitled to his good name and to the esteem in by others which he is held by others, and has a right to claim that his reputation shall not be disparaged by defamatory statements made about him to a third person or persons without lawful justification or excuse.
Publication of any matter that lowers one’s estimation in the eyes of the public is a defamatory statement. Defamation can therefore be defined as act of publishing that reduces or casts aspersions on the character of a person and the status that he or she enjoys in society. A defamatory statement is one which lowers a person in the estimation of the right thinking members of the society, or causes him to be shunned or avoided or exposed to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to convey an imputation on him injurious to him in his office, profession, calling, trade or business. For there to be defamation four distinct factors have to be present
	Reference to a fact that should be provable
	an attack on honor 
	Regard to a person or body
	Nothing in the attitude and behavior of a person or group justify being discredited this way.
Libel:  defamation by written words or by communication in some tangible form. The elements of a libel suit include
	Defamation: a statement is defamatory if it injures a person’s reputation, lowering that person in the estimation of the community or deterring third persons from associating or doing business with that person.
	Identification: the plaintiff must prove the audience would associate him/her with the defamatory statement. This requires proving that readers, listeners or viewers would have understood that the statement was about the plaintiff.  
	Publication: the statement should have appeared on a newspaper or on a television broadcast.
	Falsity: Proof that the statement about the plaintiff is false
	injury: the defamation statement must have injures the reputation of the plaintiff
	Fault; refers to the state of mind of the person who uttered the allegedly defamatory statement. Did the publisher intentionally or negligently say something false and defamatory?
•	Privacy
The law recognizes four kinds of invasion of privacy:
	 Intrusion: A lawsuit for intrusion requires that one person intentionally intrude on the solitude or seclusion of another in a manner that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. Gathering information about a person by examining public records and interviewing friends, relatives, enemies and associates is perfectly legal, even if the subject of investigation objects. Nor are reporters intruding on a person’s solitude or seclusion by requesting interviews. To commit intrusion, they would have to invade some area of in which the person had a reasonable expectation of privacy (a persons home, a hotel room, a hospital room etc). News reporters may not enter a person’s home or other private property without permission. Doing so would be a clear case of intrusion. It would be grounds for a trespass action. It is possible to invade another person’s privacy without physically entering that person’s  property, for example by using electronic eavesdropping devices, tapping a telephone line, looking into a bedroom window with binoculars or using a powerful telephoto lens to take pictures of people inside their homes.  
	Giving publicity to private facts: everybody has secrets and most people would be upset if their secrets were made public. Lawsuits for publicity to private facts are a way people can receive damages when their secrets are revealed. 
	False light: A false light suit requires that publicity place a person in a false light and that the false light be highly offensive to a reasonable person. 
	Misappropriation: any person who uses the name or likeness of another for his or her own use or benefit may be sued for invasion of privacy by misappropriation. 
•	Copyright
Copyright relates to artistic creations, such as books, music, paintings and sculptures, films and technology based works such as computer programs and electronic database. Copy right is also known as author’s right. 
There are two types of rights under copyright. Economic rights allow the rights owner to derive financial reward from the use of his works by others. Moral rights allow the author to take certain actions to preserve the personal link between him and the work. The right to object to any distortion or modification of the work, or other derogatory action in relation to the work, which would be prejudicial to the authors honor or reputation (sometimes called the right of integrity.)
Most copyright laws state that the author or rights owner has the right to authorize or prevent certain acts in relation to a work. The rights owner of a work can prohibit or authorize:
i)	its reproduction in various forms, such as printed publications or sound recordings;
ii)	the distribution of copies;
iii)	its public performance;
iv)	its broadcasting or other communication to the public;
v)	its translation into other languages;
vi)	Its adaptation, such as a novel into screen play.
These rights are explained in more detail in the following paragraphs.
i)	Rights of reproduction, distribution, rental and importation
The right of the copyright owner to prevent others from making copies of the work without his authorization is the most basic right protected by copyright legislation. The right to control the act of reproduction –be it the reproduction of books by a publisher, or the manufacture by a record producer of compact discs containing recorded performances of musical works- is the legal basis for many forms of exploitation of protected works. Many laws include a right specifically to authorize distribution of copies of works. Another right which is achieving increasingly a wide recognition is the right to authorize rental of copies of certain categories of works, such as musical works in sound recordings, audio visual works and computer programs. This became necessary in order to prevent abuse of the copyright owner’s right of reproduction when technological advances made it easy for rental for rental shop customers to copy such works. Finally, some copyright laws include a right to include a right to control importation of copies as a means to prevent erosion of the principle of territoriality of copyright; that is; the legitimate economic interests of the copyright owner would be endangered if he could not exercise the rights of reproduction and distribution on a territorial basis.
ii)	Rights of public performance, broadcasting, communication to the public and making available to the public
A public performance is considered to include any performance of a work at a place where the public is or can be present. The right of public performance entitles the author or other copyright owner to authorize live performance of a work, such as a play in the theatre. The right of broadcasting covers the transmission for public reception of sounds, or of images and sounds, by wireless means, whether by radio, television or satellite. When a work is communicated to the public, a signal is distributed by wire or wireless means, which can be received only by persons who possess the equipment necessary to decode the signal. 
iii)	Translation and adaptation rights
The act of translating or adapting a work protected by copyright also requires authorization from the rights owner. Translation means the expression of a work in a language other than that of the original version. Adaptation is generally understood as the modification of a work to create another work, for example adapting a novel to make a film. Translation and adaptations are themselves works protected by copyright. So in order to publish a translation or adaptation, authorization must be obtained both from the owner of the copyright in the original work and from the owner of copyright in the translation on adaptation.
Duration of copyright: The period or duration of copyright begins from the moment when the work has been created or when it has been expressed in a tangible form. It continues until sometime after the death of the author. The purpose of this provision is to enable the author’s successor to benefit economically from exploitation of the work after the author’s death. In countries party to the Berne Convention, the duration of copyright provided for any national law is a general rule the life of the author plus not less than 50 years after his death.
Fair use/Fair dealing: This allows use of works without the authorization of the rights owner, taking into account factors such as the nature and purpose of the use, including whether it is for commercial purposes; the nature of the work used; the amount of the work used in relation to the work as a whole; and the likely effect of the use on the potential commercial value of the work.
•	Censorship
Supervision and control of the information and ideas that are circulated among the people within a society. In modern times, censorship refers to the examination of books, periodicals, plays, films, television and radio programs, news reports, and other communication media for the purpose of altering or suppressing parts thought to be objectionable or offensive. The objectionable material may be considered immoral or obscene, heretical or blasphemous, seditious or treasonable, or injurious to the national security. Thus, the rationale for censorship is that it is necessary for the protection of three basic social institutions: the family, the church, and the state.
MEDIA ETHICS
Journalist must work ethically, which means acting and thinking morally. To be moral means to distinguish between right and wrong.
Ethical issues
i)	Stealing and fabricating information: Plagiarism is copying somebody else’s work or taking somebody else’s ideas and trying to pass them off as his or her own. It is illegal and unethical for a journalist to use another’s work.
ii)	Using sources: Journalists search for and interview people who can be sources of their stories. A source may be someone who witnessed an accident or who is an authority on a particular issue. Journalists seek sources with different opinions so that all sides of an issue are presented.
Using friends and relatives: you should not use your friends and relatives as sources for your stories.
iii)	Quoting: Journalists use sources’ words in their stories in the form of direct quotes; partial quotes necessitate quote marks to signify the sources’ original, exact wording. Indirect quotes do not use quotation marks because they paraphrase or restate in different words what the source said.
iv)	Recording interviews: tape recorders and video cameras: Journalist should not secretly record their interviews with sources. Reporters let sources know they would like to record the interview. The use of hidden cameras raises some issues audio recording don’t raise. Audiotapes record only a person’s voice and reporters use them to make sure they have complete, accurate information. Reporters rarely publish the tape itself or even a transcript of it. Video cameras however, also record people’s faces, clothing and actions. These tapes often end up on television or the internet. Many people would consider hidden cameras a greater violation of privacy than hidden tape recorders.
v)	Conflict of interest: A conflict of interest arises when journalist, their friends or relatives, or news organizations are in a position to benefit directly from the stories they cover. Conflicts may take various forms, but many news organizations have adopted policies to cover the most common ones
-accepting gifts
-accepting trips
-participating in the news
-freelancing
vi)	Maintaining objectivity: Objectivity has two components: absence of bias and accuracy. Biases may subtly influence selection of story topics, sources, questions asked, story angle, organization and presentation. Objectivity also means integrating balance, fairness and accuracy within stories.
vii)	Reporting or exploiting grief: interviewing victims: Reporters often harm a news organization’s reputation when they scramble to get an early interview. Sometimes victims in shock twist facts. Or they might want to please reporters by answering questions, even when they are not certain of the accuracy of the details they supply. Victims often complain later that they were in shock at the time of the interview and are unable to recall even talking to a reporter. They sometimes recent their stories or accuse reporters of making up the interview. Many journalists have found they obtain more accurate and complete stories if they wait several days to interview victims
Hurting victims again: A news story could inflict a second injury on victims and family members who lived through a disaster and experience it again when seeing it described on television or in a newspaper.  News organizations often run stories on the anniversary of a tragic event. The fundamental questions as to the objective of the story must be considered.
viii)	Witnessing crimes and disaster: Reporters and photographers might witness terrible tragedies, such as people drowning, falling to their deaths or fleeing from fire. Journalists help other people who are in danger, particularly if they are the only ones on the scene. Journalists should help-not simply record- human beings in trouble. But when a victim is already receiving help from rescue workers, police officers, fire fighters or medical technicians, journalists will stay out of the rescuers, way and concentrate on reporting the event. 
ix)	Reporting on terrorism: Terrorists usually want publicity and have learnt to create news so compelling that news organizations are unable to ignore it. The terrorists provide genuine drama: hijackings, demands, deadlines and the treat of mass murder-such as the bombings of the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. on Sept 11. To attract even more publicity, terrorists conduct press conferences. Some allow journalists to photograph and interview their captives. Others make videotapes of their captives, sometimes showing the hostages pleading for their lives, reading the terrorist demands and warning that they will be killed if the demands are not met. Some critics insist the media coverage encourage terrorists. They believe that if the media ignored terrorists they would become discouraged and abandon their acts of violence.
x)	Altering images: The digital revolution has caused great debate about altering photos. Using adobe Photoshop or similar image editing software, photojournalists can remove a distracting object in the background of the photo without changing the essence and meaning of the picture. Journalism, whether by using words or pictures must be an accurate representation of the truth.  
xi)	Censoring advertisement and advertiser pressure: media managers should act ethically, rejecting advertisements that are tasteless or promote illegal, obscene, immoral or harmful products. For almost 200 years, newspapers published virtually every advertisement submitted to them. Editors rarely felt responsible for the content of advertisements. Rather the editors philosophy was one of let the ‘buyer beware. ’During the early 20th century there was a campaign to clean up newspapers advertising. The newspaper lost thousands of dollars in revenue, buts its publishers never objected.

CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE PRACTICE OF JOURNALISM IN KENYA

Media Council of Kenya Code of Conduct for the Practice of Journalism in Kenya
Second Schedule of the Media Act2007

1. Accuracy and Fairness
(a) The fundamental objective of a journalist is to write a fair, accurate and an unbiased story on matters of public interest. All sides of the story shall be reported, wherever possible. Comments should be obtained from anyone who is mentioned in an unfavorable context.

(b) Whenever it is recognized that an inaccurate, misleading or distorted story has been published or broadcast, it should be corrected promptly. Corrections should present the correct information and should not restate the error except when clarity demands.

(c) An apology shall be published or broadcast whenever appropriate in such manner as the Council may specify.

(d) When stories fall short on accuracy and fairness, they should not be published. Journalists, while free to be partisan, should distinguish clearly in their reports between comment, conjecture and fact.

2. Independence
Journalists should defend the independence of all journalists from those seeking influence or control over news content. They should—

(a)	gather and report news without fear or favor, and vigorously resist undue influence from any outside forces, including advertisers, sources, story, subjects, powerful individuals and special interest groups

(b)	Resist those who would buy or politically influence news content or who would seek to intimidate those who gather and disseminate news.

(c)	Determine news content solely through editorial judgment and not the result of outside influence.

3. Integrity
Journalists should present news with integrity and decency, avoiding real or perceived conflicts of interest, and respect the dignity and intelligence of the audience as well as the subjects of news. They should—

(a)	identify sources whenever possible. Confidential sources should be used only when it is clearly in public interest to gather or convey important information or when a person providing information might be harmed;

(b)	clearly label opinion and commentary;

(c)	use technological tools with skill and thoughtfulness, avoiding techniques that skew facts, distort reality, or sensationalize events;

(d) use surreptitious news gathering techniques including hidden cameras or microphones, only if there is no other way of obtaining stories of significant public importance, and if the technique is explained to the audience.

4. Accountability
Journalists and all media practitioners should recognize that they are accountable for their actions to the public, the profession and themselves. They should—

(a) actively encourage adherence to these standards by all journalists and media practitioners;

(b) respond to public concerns, investigate complaints and correct errors promptly;

(c) recognize that they are duty-bound to conduct themselves ethically.

5. Opportunity to Reply
A fair opportunity to reply to inaccuracies should be given to individuals or organizations when reasonably called for. If the request to correct inaccuracies in a story is in the form of a letter, the editor has the discretion to publish it in full or in its abridged and edited version, particularly when it is too long, but the remainder should be an effective reply to the allegations.

6. Unnamed Sources
Unnamed sources should not be used unless the pursuit of the truth will best be served by not naming the source who should be known by the editor and reporter. When material is used in a report from sources other than the reporter's, these sources should be indicated in the story.

7. Confidentiality
In general, journalists have a professional obligation to protect confidential sources of information.

8. Misrepresentation
Journalists should generally identify themselves and not obtain or seek to obtain information or pictures through misrepresentation or subterfuge. Subterfuge can be justified only in the public interest and only when material cannot be obtained by any other means.

9. Obscenity, Taste and Tone in Reporting
(a) In general, journalists should avoid publishing obscene, vulgar or offensive material unless such material contains a news value which is necessary in the public interest.
(b) In the same vein, publication of photographs showing mutilated bodies, bloody incidents and abhorrent scenes should be avoided unless the publication or broadcast of such photographs will serve the public interest.

10. Paying for News and Articles
When money is paid for information, serious questions can be raised about the credibility of that information and the motives of the buyer and the seller. Therefore, in principle, journalists should not receive any money as an incentive to publish any information.

11. Covering Ethnic, Religious and Sectarian Conflict
(a) News, views or comments on ethnic, religious or sectarian dispute should be published or broadcast after proper verification of facts and presented with due caution and restraint in a manner which is conducive to the creation of an atmosphere congenial to national harmony, amity and peace.

(b) Provocative and alarming headlines should be avoided.

(c) News reports or commentaries should not be written or broadcast in a manner likely to inflame the passions, aggravate the tension or accentuate the strained relations between the communities concerned. Equally so, articles or broadcasts with the potential to exacerbate communal trouble should be avoided.

12. Recording Interview's and Telephone Conversations
(a) Except in justifiable cases, journalists should not tape or record anyone without the person's knowledge. An exception may be made only if the recording is necessary to protect the journalist in a legal action or for some other compelling reason. In this context these standards also apply to electronic media.

(b) Before recording a telephone conversation for broadcast, or broadcasting a telephone conversation live, a station should inform any party to the call of its intention to broadcast the conversation. This, however, does not apply to conversation whose broadcast can reasonably be presumed, for example, telephone calls to programmes where the station customarily broadcasts calls.

13. Privacy
(a) The public's right to know should be weighed against the privacy rights of people in the news.

(b) Journalists should stick to the issues.

(c) Intrusion and inquiries into an individual's private life without the person's consent are not generally acceptable unless public interest is involved. Public interest should itself be legitimate and not merely prurient or morbid curiosity. Things concerning private affairs are covered by the concept of privacy except where these impinge upon the public.

14. Intrusion into Grief and Shock
(a) In cases involving personal grief or shock, inquiries should be made with sensitivity and discretion.

(b) In hospitals, journalists should identify themselves and obtain permission from a responsible executive before entering non-public areas of hospitals or similar institutions to pursue enquiries.

15. Sex Discrimination
Women and men should be treated equally as news subjects and news sources.

16. Financial Journalism
(a) Journalists should not use financial information they receive in advance for their own benefit, and should not pass the information to others.

(b) Journalists should not write or broadcast about shares, securities and other market instruments in whose performance they know they or their close families have a significant financial interest, without disclosing the interest to the editor.

(c) Journalists should not buy or sell, directly or through nominees or agents, shares or securities and other market

17. Letters to the Editor
An editor who decides to open a column on a controversial subject is not obliged to publish all the letters received in regard to that subject. The editor may select and publish only some of them either in their entirety or the gist thereof. However, in exercising this right, the editor should make an honest attempt to ensure that what is published is not one-sided but presents a fair balance between the pros and the cons of the principal issue. The editor shall have the discretion to decide at which point to end the debate in the event of a rejoinder upon rejoinder by two or more parties on a controversial subject.

18. Protection of Children
Children should not be identified in cases concerning sexual offences, whether as victims, witnesses or defendants. Except in matters of public interest, for example, cases of child abuse or abandonment, journalists should not normally interview or photograph children on subjects involving their personal welfare in the absence, or without the consent, of a parent or other adult who is responsible for the children. Children should not be approached or photographed while at school and other formal institutions without the permission of school authorities.
In adhering to this principle, a journalist should always take into account specific cases of children in difficult circumstances.

19. Victims of Sexual Offences
The media should not identify victims of sexual assault or publish material likely to contribute to such identification.
Such publications do not serve any legitimate journalistic or public need and may bring social opprobrium to the victims and social embarrassment to their relations, family, friends, community, religious order and to the institutions to which they belong. 
20. Use of Pictures and Names
As a general rule, the media should apply caution in the use of pictures and names and should avoid publication when there is a possibility of harming the persons concerned.
Manipulation of pictures in a manner that distorts reality should be avoided. Pictures of grief, disaster and those that embarrass and promote sexism should be discouraged.

21. Innocent Relatives and Friends
The media should generally avoid identifying relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused of crime unless the reference to them is necessary for the full, fair and accurate reporting of the crime or legal proceedings.

22. Acts of Violence
The media should avoid presenting acts of violence, armed robberies, banditry and terrorist activities in a manner that glorifies such anti-social conduct. Also, newspapers should not allow their columns to be used for writings which tend to encourage or glorify social evils, warlike activities, ethnic, racial or religious hostilities.

23. Editor's Responsibilities
The editor shall assume the responsibility for all content, including advertisements, published in a newspaper. If responsibility is disclaimed, this shall be explicitly stated beforehand.

24. Advertisements
The editor should not allow any advertisement which is contrary to any aspect of this Code of Conduct. In this regard, and to the extent applicable, the editor should be guided by the Advertiser's Code of Conduct.

25. Hate Speech
Quoting persons making derogatory remarks based on ethnicity, race, creed, color and sex shall be avoided. Racist or negative ethnic terms should be avoided. Careful account should be taken of the possible effect upon the ethnic or racial group concerned, and on the population as a whole, and of the changes in public attitudes as to what is and what is not acceptable when using such terms.
