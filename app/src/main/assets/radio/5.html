<p><b>CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES</b> </p>
<p>What is confidentiality? <br/></p>
<p> The words "confidence" and "confidentiality" are based on the Latin word for trust. <br/>When you are given information in confidence, this usually means that you promise that you will not tell anyone else where you got it from.<br/> Your confidential informant trusts you to keep their identity secret. Agreeing to accept non-attributable information is the most common example of confidentiality.</p>
<p>People usually ask for confidentiality because they are afraid of other people finding out they gave you information.<br/> There are all sorts of reasons why they need confidentiality: </p>
<p>•	They might fear that their bosses will punish them for giving the information. </p>
<p>•	They might be afraid of what other people think about them if certain information is shown to have come from them. </p>
<p> •	They might be in a position of power but limited by rules about what they can say officially.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>•	<b>When is it appropriate to use them? </b> When the participation of the subject puts them at risk of harm or personal hardship (i.e., a whistleblower who might lose his/her job, or a mole within organized crime.) </p>
<p> •	<b>How should they be identified?</b> Explain the need for anonymity to the readers and audiences.<br/> Confidential sources should be identified as accurately as possible by affiliation or status.<br/> (For example, a “senior military source” must be both senior and in the military.)</p>
<p>•<b>	How should they be checked?</b> Use of anonymous sources requires the prior approval of at least one senior editorial person (or manager) who knows the full identity of the source.<br/> This ensures editorial control, verification and honesty. As the news reporter, you must know the full identity of the anonymous source (e.g., full name, phone number, method of contact, history and background). “Anonymous” does not mean we know little about the person.<br/> It means we know everything, and are offering an agreed-upon level of protection. </p>
<p> •	<b>How they should be protected:</b> Promising sources that we will keep their identities confidential is not enough. We must spell out, precisely, two things:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <b>1.	 Levels of confidentiality</b> </p>
<p>There are three levels of confidentiality:  </p>
<p> i.	<b>Not for attribution:</b> <br/>We may quote statements directly but the source may not be named, although a general description of his or her position may be given (“a government official,” or “a party insider”).<br/> In TV and radio, the identity may be shielded by changing the voice or appearance.</p>
<p> ii.<b>	On background:</b> <br/>We may use the trust of statements and generally describe the source, but we may not use direct quotes.</p>
<p> iii.<b>	Off the record: </b><br/>We may not report the information, which can be used solely to help our own understanding or perspective. There is not much point in knowing something if it can't be reported, so this undertaking should be used sparingly, if at all. </p>
<h5> How far you are willing to go to protect the source</h5>
<p>Make it clear from the start how far you are willing to go in protecting a source.<br/> You may be ordered by a court or judicial inquiry to divulge confidential sources upon threat of jail. If you are willing to go to jail to protect a source, say so. Otherwise, spell out the conditions.<br/> To protect your credibility or your company’s finances, you may tell the source you will have to reveal their identity in order to win a damaging lawsuit.    </p>
<p> Make it clear that if a source lies or misleads you, all agreements are off.
 <br/>Don’t make any commitments to anonymous sources without consultation with senior management. Journalists should be wary about entering into arrangements that they cannot fulfill. <br/> Sometimes sources request additional protection. For example, they may ask for legal assistance or protection if they are revealed or endangered. If you and your employer agree this is reasonable, spell out the terms.
</p>
<p>Confidentiality of sources is central to the ethics of journalism. <br/>As a journalist, you rely on people telling you things. Sometimes those people do not want their identity revealed to others.<br/> Although it is always better to be able to quote someone by name, in certain circumstances you have to quote what your source says without revealing away their identity. <br/>If you name a source who has given you information in confidence, you betray their trust. They will probably never give you confidential information again. But more importantly, anyone who knows that you cannot be trusted will probably refuse to give you information in confidence. If people mistrust you, they might carry that mistrust to all journalists. Any journalist who betrays a trust weakens the whole of the profession. </p>
<p> It is important too that you do not give away any clues to the identity of a source who has asked to remain anonymous.<br/><br/> This means taking extra care in phrasing the way you describe how your information was obtained.<br/> It can also mean leaving out newsworthy pieces of information which would identify the source.</p>
<p>For example, the President’s secretary may have given you secret information in confidence or off the record.<br/><br/> If you write the story attributing the details to "sources on the President’s personal staff", you risk exposing your source, especially if there are only one or two people on the President’s personal staff.<br/> It might be better to attribute it to "sources in the President’s office" if it is a big department, or even "Government sources" if you feel that will protect your source better. Of course, your readers or listeners will judge the value of information by how close the source of it is to the event or to the people making decisions.<br/> You need to balance the need to show that your sources are close to the centre of the information (and therefore reliable) against the need to protect the identity of a confidential source. </p>
<p>In some cases, your editor will ask who your confidential source is.<br/><br/> Editors often want to know so that they can assess how reliable the information is. After all, they too can be sued or sent to jail for what is published or broadcast. <br/>You must get approval from your source before you reveal their name even to your editor. Once you do so, your editor must guard that confidentiality as strongly as you do. </p>
<p>This promise of confidentiality is particularly hard to keep in cases where the law may demand that you reveal your sources. <br/><br/>In many countries, courts, tribunals, parliamentary committees and royal commissions can order you to reveal your sources of information if they think that this will help them in the administration of justice. <br/>If you fail to obey their order you may be fined or imprisoned (or both) for contempt.<br/> In some cases, journalists have been jailed for lengthy terms, to be released only when they purge their contempt by revealing the information first demanded by the court. It is more common for journalists to be released from their promise of confidentiality when the source himself comes forward to give his identity. </p>
<p>Journalists are bound by the law; but they believe it is in the best interests of society to have a way in which injustice, abuse and corruption can be made public. <br/>It is not in society's best interests to have only one channel (the legal system) through which wrongdoing can be brought to light.<br/> The legal system itself has flaws, so there must be other methods of correcting wrongs; journalism can be one of those ways. </p>
<p>You must not see confidentiality only as protecting one source of information; it is also protecting freedom of speech. </p>
<p>Once you have given your word to a source that you will protect their confidentiality, you must stick to that promise all the way, even if that takes you to prison. Unless the source agrees, you cannot tell the police, the judge, your editor or even your mother. </p>
<p> So if you do not feel that you can go to jail to protect a confidential source, do not give your promise to them in the first place. <br/>Tell them at the start of any interviews that you will reveal their names if ordered by a court. They will probably then refuse to give you any more information.</p>
<h4>ATTRIBUTION OF NEW SOURCES</h4>
<p> When you get information from a source, you normally need to attribute that information to someone.<br/> Attribution means to tell your readers or listeners the name and title of the person you interviewed or document you got the information from. You do it, for example, through the verb "to say" or a phrase like "according to ...."
There are three levels of attribution, depending on whether your source is happy about being publicly identified or whether they want to keep some secrecy about what they tell you. These three
</p>
<h5>On the record</h5>
<p> This means that the information and quotes can be used and the source fully identified. <br/> Most information you are given will be on the record. People will tell you the details openly and allow you to quote their names and titles.</p>
<p> It is always best to get information on the record.<br/> You can remain accurate by using the exact words people say. <br/>You can also make the story seem more human by using direct quotes (or by using their voices on radio and television). But most important, people judge what they read or hear by the person who says it. They are much more likely to take notice if the Chief Justice says he believes in capital punishment than if the man who sweeps the street says it. <br/>On the record comments have an extra level of understanding for people because they know who is speaking and exactly what was said.</p>
<h5>On background/Non-attributable, </h5>
<p> This means the information and quotes can be used, but the source cannot be identified by name.<br/>
Instead, the reporter needs to figure out some kind of description of the source that will protect his or her identity, but tell the reader that the source is authoritative and to be trusted. <br/>For instance, someone speaking on background may be described as “an official in the Home Ministry with direct knowledge about the programme,” a spokesperson for...", "a reliable source at..." or "sources within..." These should only be used if you cannot convince the source to go on the record. They are an admission that you cannot tell the whole truth.
</p>
<p>If your source refuses to go on the record, ask them if they mind some information being used and attributed to them, but leaving the more sensitive information not attributed specifically to them. They may allow their name to be used for certain parts but not for others. 
Sometimes a source will give you information on the understanding that you can use the information but not attribute it to them.<br/> Your source may do this for one of several reasons. Perhaps they are not officially allowed to give you the information, but they think it could be made public. Perhaps they do not want to be in the public eye
 </p>
<p> You should try to avoid making any agreement to accept non-attributable information unless it is unavoidable.<br/> Your job as a journalist is to pass on news as accurately as possible.<br/> Unattributed stories will not seem as accurate to your audience as stories where information is attributed</p>
<h5>Off the record </h5>
<p> (which means you cannot use either the information or the source's name)</p>
<p>Off-the record means the reporter cannot use any information or quotes from the interview, nor can he even tell others he talked to the source. It is as if the interview never took place. <br/>The only thing the reporter can do is verify the information with other sources. The reporter also retains the right to inform his boss about the conversation and the source’s identity but the promise of anonymity will extend to the news outlet.  </p>
<p>You will occasionally be given information on the understanding that it is totally off the record.<br/> Although you will have to ask your source exactly what they mean by such a phrase, it usually means that you should not even write about what they tell you. And you must certainly not use their name. </p>

<p>People usually give information off the record when they want you to understand the background to something which is too sensitive for them to talk publicly about. <br/>For example, you might get a tip-off of a major police operation planned for the next day against the hide-out of a criminal gang.<br/> You ask the police chief for more information, but he will obviously not want you to publish anything which might warn the gang. On the other hand, he might not want to say "no comment" because you might start asking questions somewhere else.<br/> So he might say he will tell you off the record, on condition that you do not tell anyone else. </p>
<p> Because he is asking you a favor - that is to keep secret something you already know a little bit about - you should expect a favor<br/>
 in return. If you agree not to publish details of the story before the raid, ask him whether, as a sign of goodwill on his part, he will allow you to accompany the police on the raid.<br/> You will then beat all your competitors to the story of the raid itself and have a scoop.
</p>
<p> One thing to remember about any request to treat information off the record is that it is only a request.<br/> You can agree or disagree. If a person says they will only speak to you off the record, you must decide how important their information is - and whether you can get it from somewhere else.<br/> If you cannot, perhaps you can agree to their conditions. <br/>In any case, you should bargain with them to give it on the record or at least non-attributed.</p>
<p> If a person gives you an interview and only tells you at the end that it was all off the record, argue that they should have said so earlier and not wasted your time. You are in a strong position because you now know what it is they want to keep a secret.</p>
<h4>USING ASSUMED NAMES</h4>
<p>You occasionally have to protect a source's identity by giving them an assumed name. This arises most often when you are writing about the victims of some kind of abuse, usually in feature articles or documentaries.<br/> These people may not mind you telling their story, but they do not want other people to know exactly who they are. </p>
<p>Children especially should be protected, although you can use assumed names for anyone with a good reason to have their identity kept secret, such as alcoholics, drug addicts or battered wives.<br/>
It is usual in such cases to give the person assumed name, for example "Tony" or "Juanita", and no surname. <br/>You must, of course, tell your readers or listeners that this is not the person's real name, but is being used to protect them. If you use a picture them, make sure they are not recognizable in it.<br/> If you use their voice, it is common practice in radio and television to electronically change it so it cannot be recognized.
 </p>
<p> You may also have to disguise other facts of the story if there is a chance that these will lead people to identify the person. <br/>This should only be done after careful consideration and with the approval of your editor.</p>
<p> As a journalist, you can always decline to accept information from a source unless they agree to be identified.<br/> However, once you have made the promise not to identify them, you must never break your word.<br/> If you do, people will never talk to you again. This introduces us to the idea of confidentiality, one of the most important areas of journalism ethics.</p>
