<h4>SOURCES OF NEWS</h4>
<h5>1.	Primary sources</h5>
<p> A primary source is a person with first hand information on a topic.<br/> A primary source may either be a person or a written document or official report on a topic. Through primary sources of information, a journalist obtains first hand information about an issue. <br/>Primary sources of information can also be described as those providing direct evidence or describing direct experience (The people directly involved in the events (victim of a car accident)). They are usually the best sources of information about their part of what happened.<br/> They should be able to give you accurate details and also supply strong comments</p>
<h5>2.	Secondary source </h5>
<p>Secondary sources are those providing context, background, or second-hand information.<br/> It involves archival research and this include library research, searches on the Internet, searches of media houses libraries, archives, books, public and private records, as well as the journalist’s own private observations and documentation.<br/> Also included are reference works such as yearbooks, almanacs, encyclopedia, and biographical references. <br/><br/>Also within this category are Internet sources, which offer to the journalist speedy access to information, ranging from public to private documents.<br/> Secondary sources can be used to add weight and authority. These will be considered below. </p>
<p>To get some background information about the area one is reporting on, written materials are very important. <br/><br/>Some of these written materials may include: Past newspaper articles, Books, Magazines, Journals, Legal documents, Archival documents
The official police report of an incident or comments by someone's press officer can be called secondary sources. <br/>Secondary sources are not usually as reliable as primary sources. Most eyewitnesses should be treated as secondary sources for journalists because, although they are able to tell what they think they have seen, they are often not trained for such work and can be very inaccurate, without meaning to be. <br/>You have to assess the reliability of secondary sources and if necessary tell your readers or listeners where the information came from.
 </p>
 <h5>3.	Online/internet/digital sources</h5>
<p> The Internet can be used to locate and use both primary and secondary sources. Itule and Douglas (2008) classify the Internet toolbox into the following:</p>
<p>•	<b>On-line newspaper archives: </b><br/>With a number of newspapers now on-line journalists can access past and current newspaper stories from the computer without necessarily going to the newspaper houses.<br/> Through on-line newspaper access, a journalist can quickly access the necessary information in the development of a story thus making news gathering faster and less strenuous. </p>
<p> •<b>	E-mail:</b><br/> E-mail allows the reporter to send personal messages to individuals thus providing more privacy. <br/>It is also an efficient way to communicate with hard to reach individuals.<br/> Added to this lengthy information and responses can be sent faster. <br/>The responses sent can be cut and pasted as part of a reporter’s story thus avoiding misquotes and other accusations primary sources often accuse reporters of.</p>
<p>•	<b>Newsgroups:</b> <br/>This is also known as Usenet.  Newsgroup messages are posted publically and are available for anyone to read and respond to.<br/> Newsgroups can be a good source for story ideas as it can serve as an alert of developing topics of concern to a group.<br/> It is also a good source for finding people who are directly affected by some of the topical issues discussed through the newsgroups. </p>
<p> •	<b>On-line chatting:</b><br/> This method involves real-time typed ‘conversations’ with others who are on the internet at the same time. With this method, a journalist can conduct on-line interviews.</p>
<p> •	<b>Search engines:</b> <br/>These are also called web spiders or robots. They are indexes that are generated by software programs that systematically roam the Web and automatically index the words from any Web pages they find.<br/> Such Web pages can be quite comprehensive, tallying literally billions of Web pages.<br/> Its major limitation though is that it can only make crude evaluations of the usefulness of any given page.<br/> The most prominent of the search engines is Google. Others include Opera, explorer etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following are some of the sources of news in a media house: </p>
<p> 1.	Reporter.<br/> One of the most reliable sources of information (although not completely reliable) are other journalists. <br/><br/>They may be your colleagues or reporters from a news agency which supplies your organization. <br/>If they are well trained, experienced and objective, their reports will usually be accurate and can be trusted. The greatest source we rely on him/her because he/she can smell news.<br/> There are beat/specialist reporters (assigned to a specific area such as sports, business, courts, etc.), general/spot (anywhere you cover) and investigative reporters.</p>
<p> 2.	Contacts.<br/> Contains a list of details of persons whom you can access any time.</p>
<p>3.	Tip-off. <br/>Occasionally someone will call with a story tip-off but refuse to give their name. These are said to be anonymous (meaning "no name"). <br/>These are the most dangerous sources of information and should only be used with extreme caution. Although anonymous tip-offs can provide good story ideas, they must never be used without a lot of checking. <br/>If they are wrong, you will be held directly responsible unless you have checked what they said with other more reliable sources.Often people who ring up with a tip-off will tell you their name if asked, but on the promise that you do not reveal their name to anyone else.<br/><br/> You must still cross-check what they say because, of course, you cannot quote them as your source if there is any dispute about accuracy, for example if you are taken to court for defamation.Tips is simply information given to a reporter about a possible story.<br/> Information given briefly to enable you get and access news by follow-ups later to make good news. </p>
<p>4.	News agencies. KNA, BBC, AP, CNN, Reuters, etc. </p>
<p> Freelancers/stringers.</p>
<p> 6.	News room desk/docket. List of stories/events and their time and we use to develop the docket. Whoever will be in charge (assigning) so that you know what events that need to be covered, time and person assigned. </p>
<p>Pressure groups. </p>
<p> 8.	Press agents/PR. Give handouts, press releases, videos etc.</p>
