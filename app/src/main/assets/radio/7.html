<h2>WRITING FOR BROADCAST MEDIA</h2>

<h3>Characteristics of Broadcast Writing</h3>
<p><i>Broadcast journalism uses the  five Cs: Correctness, Clarity, Conciseness, Colour and conversational style.</i></p>

<p>1.	Correctness or Accuracy.<br/> Everything a broadcast journalist does must contribute to the telling of an accurate story.</p>
<p>2.	Clarity.<br/> Good broadcast writers employ clear, precise language that contains no ambiguity. Listeners and viewers cannot go back and re-hear news broadcast as they might be able to read a newspaper account more than once. They must understand what is said the first time.  They also achieve clarity by thoroughly knowing and understanding their subject.</p>
<p>3.	Conciseness.<br/> This is critical due to time constraints hence tight phrasing. A number of strategies are used to attain conciseness. 
	<p>(i) Elimination of all but most necessary adjectives and adverbs. Broadcasters know that their stories are built on nouns and passive voice. Instead they rely on strong, active verbs that will allow the listener to form a picture of the story.</p> 
	<p>(ii) Use of short, simple sentences.</p> 
<p>4.	Colour.<br/> This refers to writing that allows the listener to paint a picture of the story or event such as the inclusion of pertinent and insightful details in the story allowing the personality of the writer or news reader to come through in a story.<br/> Color is provided by observing and paying attention close attention to details, and using those details in your copy.</p>
<p>5.	Conversational style.<br/> Even the clearest, simplest newspaper style tends to sound stilted when it is read aloud.<br/> Broadcast writing must sound conversational because people will be reading it aloud.  Broadcast news should be written for the ear, not  the eye. The writer should keep in mind that someone is going to say the words and others will listen to them. <br/>This causal or conversational style, however, does not give the writer the freedom to break rules of grammar, to use slang or off-color phrasing or to use language that  might be offensive to listeners. The broadcast writer should try to focus attention on the content of the writing and not the writing itself.</p>
<p>6.	Immediacy.<br/> Another important characteristic of broadcast writing is emphasis on the immediate. While past tense verbs are preferred in the print media, broadcasters use the present tense as much as possible</p>

<h3>Story Structure for broadcast news</h3>
<p>The most common structure for broadcast news is called dramatic unity.  This structure  has three parts, namely:  climax, cause and effect.</p> 
<p><b>a)	Climax.</b> The climax of the story gives the listener the point in the story in about the same way as a lead in a print news story does; it tells the listener what happened. </p>
<p><b>b)	Cause.</b>The cause part of the story tells why it happened-the circumstances surrounding the event.</p>
<p><b>c)	Effect.</b>The effect portion of the story gives the listener the context of the story and possible some insight about what the story means.</p> 

<p>The following two examples demonstrate the dramatic unity story structure:</p>
<p>Example 1	</p>

<p>Climax:  Business owners in Eldoret Municipality will be paying an average of  3,000 Kenya Shillings more for their business permits next financial  year.</p>

<p>Cause: The municipal council   general meeting defeated several delaying amendments this afternoon and passed the   town clerk’s controversial revenue-raising  motion by a 15 to 14 vote. The motion  had been the subject of intense debate for more than a week.</p>

<p>Effect:  The motion now goes to the minister 
for local government for approval. Estimates 
are that the measure will raise about 40 
million Kenya shillings in new revenue  for the 
municipality next financial year. Primary and 
secondary shools will get most of that money. 
Passage of the motion is a major victory for 
the town clerk and his education program.</p>

<p>Example 2</p>
	<p>Climax:  Many children in public schools in Nairobi will begin their classes at least a half an hour later next year.</p>

<p>Cause: The  City School Board last night voted to rearrange the school bus schedule for next year as a cost-cutting measure.</p>

<p>Effect:  The new schedule will require most  primary school children to begin school one half later than they do now. Most secondary school  students will begin one half hour earlier.</p>



<h3>Writing for the Ear (radio)</h3>
<p>Writing for radio follows a distinct set of rules that must be followed if the broadcast is to be effective and professional.</p>
<p>1.	Use proper format: Format requirements vary by radio station, but in general, scripts should be in all caps and double spaced. Information should also be provided on sound cuts, including speaker, the type of cut (actuality, wrap, voicer), length, and outcue.</p>
<p>2.	Write conversationally: Radio scripts should be akin to normal speaking style. This varies dramatically from written writing, as material written for print tends to be more formal. In short, write as though you are telling the story to a friend.</p>
<p>3.	Use word economy: Do not use ten words if the message can be effectively conveyed using five.</p>
<p>4.	Use present tense: With news radio, the emphasis is on what is happening. Therefore, all scripts should be written in present tense.
Use up-to-date tenses</p>
<p>The single greatest advantage of broadcasting is immediacy. You can inform your listener as an event is happening, or immediately afterwards, without waiting for typesetters or printing presses.</p><p> Do not waste that advantage.</p>
<p>Keep all tenses as up-to-date as possible. Use the present tense or the tense nearest to the present and, whenever possible, use a continuous tense to tell your listener that a thing is still happening, as they listen.</p>
<p>Right:</p>  
<p>The Prime Minister says he expects an increase in imports this year.</p>   	<p>Wrong:</p>               
<p>The Prime Minister said he expected an increase in imports this year. 
</p><p>Right:</p>
<p>Leaders of the main opposition parties in Fiji have been meeting.</p>    	<p>Wrong:     </p><p>          
Leaders of the main opposition parties in Fiji met over the weekend</p><p>
Compare the tenses in the following examples. The verbs are in italics.
There is no room for words such as "yesterday", "last week" or "last Monday" in the intro of a broadcast news story. If the date makes the story seem old or stale, hide it down in the main body of the story.</p>
<p>5.	Use short sentences: Spoken language is comprised of brief sentences, and material written for radio should reflect that. Providing the radio anchor with short sentences will also help with delivery, as it’s difficult to anticipate the direction of a long, run-on sentence.</p>
<p>6.	Use dashes for acronyms that are spelled out: In the case of “AIDS,” you would write “AIDS,” because this is how it’s spoken. But if an acronym is spelled out, as in the case of CBS, it should be written “C-B-S.”</p>
<p>7.	Note network affiliation: When utilizing reporter- or network-generated sound cuts, always note the network affiliation.</p>
<p>8.	Don’t be repetitive: When writing around sound cuts in the case of a reporter- or anchor-read wrap, do not repeat information that’s mentioned in the cut. This redundancy is a waste of airtime. Instead, the lead-in should serve as an introduction to what the listeners can expect to hear.</p>
<p>9.	Avoid clichés or “groaners:” These phrases can be very distracting and void of meaning. And when the listener is distracted by a cliché, his attention is no longer focused on the story.<p/>
<p>10.	Provide pronunciation guides. In the case of uncommon or difficult-to-pronounce names, provide a notation on pronunciation following every instance of the name.</p>
<p>11.	Avoid “he/she” ambiguity: When referencing more than one individual in a script, always reference that person by name or title. Utilizing “he” or “she” can be confusing, particularly when there’s multiple individuals referenced in the story.</p>
<p>12.	Ensure clarity and flow: A story that’s clear in the form of a newspaper article may not be clear when spoken aloud on the air. When written, a story may also have a nice flow, but that flow is not conversational. So read all scripts aloud prior to submission.</p>
<p>13.	Only mention what’s necessary: Lengthy, detail-inclusive stories should be left to the newspapers. News radio serves to provide only the most vital facts in a story. Including unnecessary information will waste valuable airtime and bore listeners.</p>
<p>14.	Do not include ages: Many writers are inclined to include the ages of individuals involved in crimes and other similar stories. But unless there is something highly relevant and remarkable about the individual’s age (i.e. an 11-year-old murderer), it should be omitted. One exception is in the case of the description of a suspect sought by police. In this instance, the person’s age is vital to a citizen’s ability to identify the individual.</p>
<p>15.	Estimate when it comes to numbers: Do not mention “193 students.” Instead, mention, “nearly 200 students.” Exact numbers are not going to be comprehended by the listener.</p>
<p>16.	Write out numbers one through ten: With numbers over ten, they should be entered numerically.<p>
<p>17.	Downplay unconfirmed facts or unknown information: Credibility is harmed when an anchor begins a story by mentioning the information that the station doesn’t yet have. Instead of beginning a story by saying, “Police have not released any information in this case,” mention what is known. Then conclude with, “Additional information is expected soon,” only if it’s vital information that the listeners should not be without.</p>

<h3>Writing for the Eye (television)</h3>
<p>1.	Keep It Simple. <br/> Newspaper reporters wanting to show off their writing style occasionally insert a fancy word into a story. But that just doesn't work in broadcast news writing. Broadcast copy must be as simple as possible. Remember, viewers aren't reading what you're writing, they're hearing it. People watching TV or listening to the radio generally don't have time to check a dictionary. So keep your sentences simple and use basic, easily understood words. If you find you've put a longish word in a sentence, replace it with a shorter one. </p><p>Example:</p>
<p>•	Print:The physician conducted an extensive autopsy on the decedent.</p>
<p>•	Broadcast:The doctor did an autopsy on the body.</p>
<p>2.	Keep It Short.<br/> Generally, sentences in broadcast copy should be even shorter than those found in print articles. Why? Shorter sentences are more easily understood than long ones. Also, remember that broadcast copy must be read out loud. If you write a sentence that's too long, the news anchor will be gasping for breath just to finish it. Individual sentences in broadcast copy should be short enough to be easily read in one breath. </p><p>Example: </p>
<p>•	Print: President Barrack Obama and congressional Democrats sought to ease Republican complaints about a massive economic stimulus plan Friday, meeting with GOP (Grand Old Party) leaders in the White House and promising to consider some of their recommendations.</p>
<p>•	Broadcast: President Barrack Obama met with Republican leaders in Congress today. The Republicans aren't happy with Obama's big economic stimulus plan. Obama says he'll consider their ideas.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>KISS</b></p>
<p>Keep it short and simple. You should not try to get too much information into any sentence. Although you use the inverted pyramid style of story writing, you may only be able to use one or two concepts (ideas) per sentence. You cannot get as much detail into a radio or television story as you can into a newspaper story.</p><p>
You cannot expect your listener to understand the Who? What? Where? When? Why? and How? of a story all in the first paragraph or even the first two paragraphs. Although as a good journalist you should not leave any essential questions unanswered, you may find that it takes all the time available for a single story to communicate only a few basic facts. It is often said that you could put all the words in a ten minute radio bulletin on one page of a newspaper.</p><p>
Stick to one or two key points per sentence. No sentence should be longer than 20 words, except in unusual circumstances. Just as a mother feeds a child one spoonful at a time, allowing the child to swallow each spoonful before taking the next, you should spoon feed your listener. Give them one piece of information at a time so that it can be digested before the next piece.</p><p>
Where necessary, split a long and involved sentence into two or more shorter clearer sentences, as you would in conversation.</p>
<p>Right: </p>
<p>Japanese boats have returned to fish in Fijian waters.                

They were banned last year because of an international row over net sizes.        

Now they are back in the waters off Vanua Levu. 
</p><p>   
  	Wrong:</p><p>
 	Japanese fishing boats, which were banned from Fijian waters during an international row over net sizes last year, returned to fish in the waters off Vanua Levu on Monday.</p>
	
<p>It may take more words, but what good is the most skilful sentence in history if the listener cannot understand it?</p><p>
It might help you to write short and simple sentences if you first try to imagine how the story might appear in a newspaper headline.</p><p>
Once you have reduced it to the bones of a headline, you can put some flesh on it for radio and television. Don't forget though that, whereas newspaper headlines can be incomplete sentences, without words like the and a, radio and television news must be in complete sentences.</p><p>
Look at the following example and notice how we take the details in the information, strip it down to the bones by writing a headline, then add words to turn the headline into a complete sentence, suitable for radio or television.</p><p>
Information:</p><p>
A contract for the construction of a new road between Madang and Lae has been awarded to a Korean company.</p>
<p>Headline:</p><p>
Koreans to build new road</p><p>
Intro:</p><p>
A Korean company is to build a new road between Madang and Lae.</p><p>
3.	Keep It Conversational. Many sentences found in newspaper stories simply sound stilted and unwieldy when read out loud. So use a conversational style in your broadcast writing. Doing so will make it sound more like real speech, as opposed to a script someone is reading. Example: </p>
<p>•	Print: Pope Benedict XVI joined U.S. President Barrack Obama and Queen Elizabeth II on Friday by launching his own YouTube channel, the latest Vatican effort to reach out to the digital generation.</p><p>
•	Broadcast: President Obama has a YouTube channel. So does Queen Elizabeth. Now Pope Benedict has one too. The Pope wants to use the new channel to reach out to young people.</p><p>
4.	Use One Main Idea per Sentence. Sentences in newspaper stories sometimes contain several ideas, usually in clauses that are broken up by commas. But in broadcast writing you really shouldn't put more than one main idea in each sentence. Why not? You guessed it - more than one main idea per sentence and that sentence will be too long. Example:</p><p>
•	Print: Gov. David Paterson appointed Democratic U.S. Rep. Kirsten Gellibrand on Friday to fill New York's vacant Senate seat, finally settling on a woman from a largely rural, eastern district of the state to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p><p>
•	Broadcast: Gov. David Paterson has appointed Democratic Congresswoman Kirsten Gellibrand to fill New York's vacant Senate seat. Gellibrand is from a rural part of the state. She will replace Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p><p>
5.	Use the Active Voice. Sentences written in the active voice just naturally tend to be shorter and more to the point than those written in the passive voice. Example: </p><p>
•	Passive: The robbers were arrested by police.</p><p>
•	Active: Police arrested the robbers.</p><p>
6.	Use a Lead-in Sentence. Most broadcast news stories start with a lead-in sentence that is fairly general. Broadcast news writers do this to alert viewers that a new story is being presented, and to prepare them for the information that is to follow. <br/>Example: </p><p>
•	"There's more bad news today from Iraq." Note that this sentence doesn't say very much. But again, it lets the viewer know that the next story is going to be about Iraq.</p> <p>The lead-in sentence almost serves as a kind of headline for the story. Here's an example of a broadcast news item. Note the use of a lead-in line, short, simple sentences and a conversational style.</p> 
<p>There's more bad news from Iraq. Four U.S. soldiers were killed in an ambush outside Baghdad today. The Pentagon says the soldiers were hunting insurgents when their Humvee came under sniper fire. The Pentagon hasn't yet released the soldiers' names.</p>
<p>7.	Put Attribution at the Start of the Sentence. Print news stories usually put the attribution, the source of the information, at the end of the sentence. In broadcast news writing we put them at the beginning. Example:</p>
<p>•	Print: Two men were arrested, police said.</p>
<p>•	Broadcast: Police say two men were arrested.</p>
<p>Put attribution first</p><p>
Attribution in radio and television goes at the front of a sentence, as it would if you were talking to that favourite aunt. </p><p>This is unlike traditional newspaper style, which commonly puts attribution such as he said at the end of the sentence, after the quote. </p><p>In newspapers, readers can see both the quote and the attribution together.</p><p> In radio and television, your listeners need to know who was speaking before they can judge what was said. </p><p>Remember the linear structure of broadcast news. </p><p>
Compare the following sentences. The attribution is in italics.</p>
<p>Right:</p> <p>
A senior government economist says that people in Papua New Guinea are paid too much.
</p>	<p>Wrong:</p><p>
People are paid too much in Papua New Guinea, a senior government economist said last night.  </p><p>
By putting the attribution up front, you are also making your sentence more active, important for broadcast news.</p><p>
8.	Leave Out Unnecessary Details. Print stories tend to include a lot of details that we just don't have time for in broadcast. Example:</p><p>
•	Print: After robbing the bank the man drove approximately 9.7 miles before being apprehended, police said.</p><p>
•	Broadcast: Police say the man robbed the bank then drove nearly 10 miles before he was caught. </p><p>

The broadcast news lead may be short on facts, but if it captures the attention of the reader, it has served its purpose for example: </p><p>
The lame duck keeps limping along. The cabinet met for the third week of its  weekly Thurdsday meetings today, and again they  failed to agree on  the draft bill to set up a local tribunal. </p><p>

The first sentence has very little of facts, but it gets the listener into the story. This  type  of story 
structure is only appropriate for certain stories, however. 
</p><p>
If the facts of the story are strong enough to gain the listener’s attention, they should be  used to open the story e.g. </p><p>

The five-cents-a-gallon gas tax is now law. President Barrack Obama  signed the bill authorizing the tax today while vacationing in Chicago.</p>
