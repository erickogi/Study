<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF RADIO AND TV BROADCASTING IN KENYA</h3>
<p>Radio is by far the dominant and most important mass medium in Africa. <br/>Its flexibility, low cost, and oral character meet Africa's situation very well. <br/>Radio remains the top medium in terms of the number of people that it reaches. Even though television has shown considerable growth (especially in the 1990s) and despite a widespread liberalization of the press over the same period, radio still outstrips both television and the press in reaching most people on the continent.  </p>
<p>•	Broadcasting is very important in Africa because a majority of Africans get their information, education and entertainment from primarily radio and then television<br/>. The press tends to have an urban bias and is dependent on literacy.  </p>
<p> •	Radio uses more African languages than television and is therefore more accessible. However, the influence and role of television has grown among urban dwellers in Africa.<br/> Television has low penetration because of the high costs of sets, lack of electricity and weak coverage. </p>
<p>Radio is the most popular mass medium in Kenya (Odhiambo,2002) with radio stations broadcasting in assorted languages.<br/> Kenya has a three-tier broadcasting system that is comprised of public/state broadcasters, commercial broadcasters, and community radio. The Kenya 2009 Population &amp; Housing Census Results indicate that 6,489,453 (74.0%) and 2,456,594 (28 %) of Kenyan households own radio and TV.  </p>

<h4>Categories of Broadcasting  </h4>
<p>According to Fraser and Estrada (2001), broadcasting can be divided into three general categories: </p>
<p><b>1.	Public-service broadcasting.</b><br/> This is generally conducted by a statutory entity, which is usually, though not necessarily, a state-supported or a state owned corporation such as KBC.<br/> Its broadcasting policies and programming are often controlled by the government/government agency.  </p>
<p><b> 2.	Commercial or private broadcasting. </b><br/>Provides programmes designed primarily for profit from advertising revenue and is owned and controlled by private individuals, or by commercial enterprises, e.g. KTN, NTV, Citizen TV, etc. </p>
<p><b>3.	Community broadcasting.</b> <br/>This is a non-profit service that is owned and managed by a particular community, usually through a trust, foundation, or association. Its aim is to serve and benefit the community.<br/> In effect, it is a public-service broadcasting venture, but serves a community rather than the whole nations, as is the usual form of public broadcasting. <br/>Its resources are derived from the community e.g. Pamoja Radio, Ghetto Radio, Mang’elete Radio etc.  </p>

<h4>Essential features of community radio  </h4>
<p> <b>.	The audience as protagonists.</b> The community radio though a form of public service broadcasting, its focus is to make its audience the main protagonists, by their involvement in all aspects of its management and programme production, and by providing them with programming that will help them in the development and social advancement of their community. </p>
<p><b>.	A special slant on news, entertainment and education.</b> The news aims to be part of an ongoing and future process which supports change and development in the community. Entertainment is provided in a form that is a collective cultural expression, rather than a featuring of refined performers. Education is more the sharing of experiences and learning from others in the community than listening to an expert or teacher talking.  </p>
<p><b>.	Principles of public access and participation.</b> It is a public interest of broadcasting that it should incorporate the principles of access and participation. Access implies the availability of broadcasting services to all citizens, while participation implies that the public is involved in planning and management and also provides producers and performers. Therefore, a community radio’s broadcast pattern reaches all members of the community it aims to serve; the community participates in formulating plans and policies for the radio service and in defining its objectives, its principles of management, and its programming. The community participates in decisions concerning programme content, duration, and schedules. Thus, people select the programmes they want. The community is free to comment and criticize. There is continuous interaction between the producers and receivers of messages. There are unrestricted opportunities for members of the community as individuals or groups to produce programmes and be helped by the radio station staff using the technical production facilities available. The community participates in the establishment and financing of the radio station.  </p>
<p><b>.	Ownership. </b>The community radio station’s facilities are almost invariably owned by the community through a trust, foundation, cooperative or some similar vehicle. However, there could be cases where formal ownership was in the hands of a body external to the community, but which has passed the facility to the community for its independent and exclusive use.  </p>
<p><b>.	Management.</b> The station’s policies, management and programming must be the responsibility of the community in order for it to be considered a true community radio station. There will usually be a representative community committee, or Board of Directors to set policies, while the day- to-day administrative and operational decisions are left to a station manager.  </p>
<p><b>	Funding. </b>A community radio station is set up and run as a non-profit organization. It relies on financial support from a diversity of sources, including donations, grants, membership fees, sponsorship, fund raising from audiences, or advertising.  </p>
<p> <b>	Editorial independence and credibility.</b> A community radio is editorially independent of central and local government, of political parties, and of commercial and religious institutions in determining its policies and programming</p>
<h4>Categories/Types of radio and TV stations </h4>
<p><b>1.	Commercial radio stations.</b> There are fully commercial stations that seek to make a profit from the sale of airtime for advertising or sponsored programs.  </p>
<p><b>2.	Religious radio stations. </b>These stations (most, but not all, Christian) use radio to communicate their faith and beliefs; some of these may carry some advertising, but most are financially supported by their sponsoring organizations and some with support from outside.  </p>
<p>3.<b> Community radio stations.</b> The third category, comprised of community radio stations, is probably the fastest growing sector. There has been strong support in some countries for the development of very local, generally low-powered FM stations broadcasting in a community's indigenous languages or dialects. These are often staffed by volunteer helpers, are run at very low cost, and are supported by outside agencies (various non-government organizations have supported some for developmental reasons).  </p>
<p>4.<b> Factional radio stations</b>. These are sometimes referred to as "clandestines") are used to promote a particular faction in a conflict. Somalia, a country without a government for the last decade of the 20th century, has several such stations, each supporting one of the warlords who control different parts of the country. There are similar clandestines in Sudan and Ethiopia. Some of these operate from neighboring countries rather than from within their nations of origin, for obvious reasons, Occasionally they may even broadcast from further afield. The factional radio category also includes the so-called hate radio stations. The most notorious of these was the Radio des Mille Collines (Radio of a Thousand Hills) in Rwanda. Broadcasting from within Rwanda (and almost certainly with the government's approval if not its backing), it was widely held to be responsible for promoting ethnic hatred and killings during the 1994 genocide.  </p>
<p> 5.<b> Humanitarian radio stations.</b> <br/>The fifth category, humanitarian radio stations, came as a counter to the influence of factional radio. The power of radio in Africa has led various aid and relief agencies, including the United Nations, to support the establishment of humanitarian radio stations that promote peace, harmony, and democracy. Such radio stations have operated in Rwanda, Somalia, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. One organization that has been prominent in supporting humanitarian radio has been the Fondation Hirondelle (Swallow Foundation) in Switzerland. It has backed radio stations in areas of conflict for limited periods in countries such as Liberia, the Central African Republic, Somalia, and Rwanda </p>
<h3>Classifying radio stations in Kenya</h3>
<p>The increase in the number of radio stations in Kenya in recent years has produced a changed media terrain intensifying competition between the players in the market. As more players join the industry, the audiences are increasingly becoming segmented. As a result, radio stations are defining and re-defining themselves in an attempt to capture a particular audience to consolidate their market share or break into their competition’s market. To understand radio broadcasting in Kenya, it will be helpful to categorize the different radio stations as the industry, which has been unstable since the advent of liberalization, works to realign itself into stability. In examining the radio industry in Kenya today, there are various notable factors that determine which group of listeners a station will appeal to. </p>
<p> A broad-based set of criteria/factors have been given by Gathigi (2009) in classifying radio stations in Kenya. Using this approach, the following classification is used: 

</p>
<p>1. Classification based on broadcasting philosophy and funding  </p>
<p>-	Public radio stations  </p>
<p>-	Commercial radio stations  </p>
<p>-	Community radio stations  </p>
<p>-	Community radio stations 
2. Classification using language 
 </p>
<p> -	Mainstream radio stations </p>
<p> -	Vernacular radio stations </p>
<p>3. Classification by reach  </p>
<p> -	National radio stations </p>
<p> -	Regional radio stations  </p>
<p> 4. Classification based on content </p>
<p>-	Split programmers  </p>
<p>-	Religious programmers  </p>
<p> -	Entertainment/music programmers </p>
<h4>1.	Classification based on broadcasting philosophy and funding </h4>
<h5>(a)	State-controlled public service radio stations </h5>
<p> The state-controlled public service broadcasters receive part of their funding from the government to offset some of their running expenses.<br/> In the recent past, the stations have increasingly sought to increase revenue generation by improving efficiency in their operations. <br/>The stations are required to air what is considered as content in the public interest. Such content includes the parliament’s proceedings and annual national budget presentations and government functions such national celebrations.<br/> The stations also air content such as broadcasts to schools that is part of the continued government effort to increase education access to all. </p>
<p>In the recent past, the level of government involvement and control in the public radio stations has significantly declined from past years and managers make most of the decisions. <br/>This is a departure from the single government-controlled media days where stations had to “toe the line”.<br/> The stations are also moving further towards independence and objectivity when dealing with political issues. The presenters for instance can criticize the government, something that would never have happened in the government monopoly era.  </p>
<p>Public service broadcasters hold the view that the public is in constant need of information, education and entertainment and it is the responsibility of radio to provide the content, irrespective of social, economic or any other factors that define the audience.<br/> The public service broadcaster’s audience is less defined. </p>
<h5>(b)	Commercial radio stations </h5>
<p>Commercial radio stations in Kenya are owned by a wide range of entities including individuals, holding companies, and institutions. <br/>The main goal of commercial radio stations is to deliver to the audiences while maximizing profits for the owners or the shareholders. <br/>The commercial stations generate most of their revenue from advertising. In Kenya, the centrality of profit defines a key difference between commercial stations and public service broadcasters as it determines how they view the audience.  </p>
<p> Commercial stations are likely to be more targeted in their audience definition. Commercial broadcasters view their audiences as commodities which they can in turn sell to the advertisers.<br/> However, commercial radio stations in Kenya exhibit different levels of targeting. </p>
<p> The urban based English language radio stations are very particular with their audience. <br/>On the other hand, those that use Swahili and vernacular and a few English commercial stations (those that seek a broader national audience) have two definitions of their target audience.<br/>  As managers put it, there is “paper” definition and the “practical” definition.<br/> The paper definition of audience is what is used to seek business from the advertisers.<br/> In practice however, the stations reach a wider audience.<br/> The paper definition of audience is narrow and therefore stations do not strictly adhere to it when designing programs as they seek a wide range of audiences in order to improve the scope of listenership.<br/> Most English urban commercial stations have a specific segment of listeners that they seek to appeal to and their definition is consistent with practice. Stations such as Kiss FM and Classic FM are good examples. </p>
<p> Commercial urban English FM stations are predominantly entertainment driven with music as the main content. Swahili and vernacular language commercial stations attempt to balance information, education, and entertainment content.<br/> There is more emphasis on news in these stations compared to the urban English FM radio stations. </p>
<h5>(c)	Community radio stations </h5>
<p>Despite the entry of multiple players in the Kenyan radio industry today, some sections of the populations still feel the desire to have an avenue through which very local and specific needs can be catered to. <br/>Community radios are small in their operations and are run by the local people for the local people. The content varies from education, information, and entertainment.<br/> The information is mainly locally generated content that addresses issues that are relevant to the local population. Community radio stations are low power with a limited reach compared to other radio stations. Some community radio stations broadcast within a radius of ten kilometers. Community radio stations are extensively used as tools for raising public awareness on issues that affect their community.  </p>
<p>There are numerous community radio stations in Kenya today in different parts of the country. <br/>In Nairobi, community radios are becoming popular in low income informal settlement areas. In Nairobi, community radio is strong in the slum settlement such as Ghetto FM in Majengo, Pamoja FM in Kibera and Koch FM in Korogocho. Pamoja FM for instance serves the Kibera slum, an informal settlement with an estimated 1.2 million people but whose total area is approximately two square kilometers.<br/> Radio Pamoja is run by community volunteers and its broadcasts do not go beyond 10 kilometers outside the slum. Radio Pamoja’s content addresses issues that are of interest to the Kibera slum dwellers. <br/>They air programs on health and sanitation, leading issues that confront the slum dwellers. Since the beginning of 2008, Pamoja FM has been airing peace education programs after the slums witnessed one of the worst waves of violence after the disputed December 2007 general elections. Another community radio Koch FM broadcasts from Korogocho slums in Nairobi, the second largest informal settlement in Nairobi. Like Pamoja FM, Koch FM is run by a group of unpaid volunteers and provides news and information about what is happening in Korogocho. The station also airs programs of community interest in areas such as health, education and sanitation.  </p>
<h4>2.	Classification using language </h4>
<p> Language has become a major factor that influences the audience that a radio station can reach.<br/> Due to multiplicity of languages in Kenya, broadcasters have identified language as a way to segment listeners into smaller groups.<br/> Using language classification, stations that use Swahili and English language, the two languages that cut across ethnic boundaries in the country, can be termed as mainstream stations. On the other hand, a host of stations employ other local African languages targeting a population that speaks that language.<br/> These are referred to as vernacular radio stations. </p>
<h5>(a)	Mainstream radio stations </h5>
<p>Mainstream radio stations belong to a broad category of stations that broadcast in a language that can be understood by the majority of the population across the nation.<br/> In Kenya, English and Swahili are two languages that cut across populations and regions. <br/>Mainstream radio stations are programmed to address general audiences in terms of social cultural backgrounds but they share common factors such as social economic status and religious beliefs </p>
<p>Mainstream station can be national in reach.<br/> Most English FM stations are mainstream and tend to do well in highly cosmopolitan areas. Nairobi region, which is the most cosmopolitan area, has always been dominated by mainstream radio stations. The current top Nairobi stations including Radio Citizen, Kiss FM, Classic FM, etc are all mainstream.<br/> These stations play more music. Other Swahili mainstream stations that broadcast in Swahili include Q FM, Radio Simba, Milele FM and Jambo FM.  </p>
<h5>(b)	Vernacular radio stations </h5>
<p>Vernacular radio stations broadcast chiefly using a local language to a target audience that understands the language of broadcast. <br/>Vernacular stations tend to broadcast to a community that is also defined by a common culture. <br/>The content such as news and different types of programs is mainly in the vernacular language. The degrees to which the stations use the language vary from station to station. For some stations such as Inooro FM, a Kikuyu station, the broadcasts are in the Kikuyu language. The presentation, news and informational programs, and all the music played on Inooro FM are in the Kikuyu language. <br/>Other stations however will present some of their content in other language mainly English and Swahili especially in news presentation. <br/>A good chunk of music is also in Swahili and English.  </p>
<p> Most vernacular stations tend to assume a regional nature because settlement patterns in Kenya are such that people of a given ethnic group are concentrated in one settlement region.<br/> Thus, the Luo audience is found in the Nyanza around Lake Region, the Kalenjin in the Northern and Southern Rift while the majority of Kikuyu audience is found in Central Kenya region. <br/>Vernacular stations in Kenya have started gaining the highest listenership in areas where their languages of broadcasts are widely spoken. </p>
<p>According to Steadman reports (2008), Inooro FM is the most listened to station in Central Kenya ahead of two other Kikuyu stations, Kameme FM and Coro FM.<br/> In Lake Region, Ramogi FM that broadcasts in Luo language has the highest listenership.<br/> Kass FM that broadcast in Kalenjin language is the most listened to station in Central Rift Valley area while Muuga FM, a Meru language station dominates the Upper Eastern region (Steadman, 2008).</P>
 <P>
Vernacular stations also attract more rural audiences because the vernacular languages are widely spoken in these areas.<br/> There is also an urban audience, but this audience is more contested because it is the same audience that the mainstream stations seek to satisfy. Most vernacular stations broadcast from the capital Nairobi and use transmitters to relay the services to their regions with their target population.<br/> None of the vernacular stations has access to national frequencies. There is a strong rapport between vernacular stations and the listeners.<br/> Due to the cultural connections, vernacular stations have become reservoirs of a community’s culture, teaching the listeners different aspects of their culture and traditions.</P> 
 
<p>The content is also highly targeted and because of this, some vernacular stations exhibit some of the characteristics of community radio.<br/> Kikuyu vernacular stations have increasingly adopted a more sensitive broadcasting where they involve the targeted community in content generation. For instance, there is more local level reporting for most stations in the grassroots levels. The stations content reflect the targeted audiences’ way of life.  </p>
<h4>3.	Classification by reach </h4>
<p> Radio stations in Kenya have varied reach.<br/>  The Communication Authority of Kenya (CAK) grants frequencies to the station to broadcast to specified regions which limits the population they can reach. <br/> Some stations are allocated frequencies to broadcast multiple regions in the country while other stations can only reach one region. <br/> Defined by the reach, the two main categories are the national stations and the regional stations. </p>
<h5>(a)	National radio stations </h5>
<p> National radio stations have a wide reach that extends to the whole country or most parts of the country. <br/> They have transmitters and repeaters distributed across the country. Although their frequencies may not be received in some particular areas, they are generally available in most regions in the country. <br/> These stations target heterogeneous audiences and use languages that cut across regions and ethnic lines. <br/> They also tend to broadcast an all inclusive content as they cater to people from different backgrounds. They try to balance religion, education, social and economic backgrounds as well as age. </p>
<p>National radio stations provide information, education, and entertainment in their program in order to cater to a wide audience’s needs. <br/> National radio stations broadcast content of national interest. For instance, they cover important political events such as general elections more widely than other stations.<br/>  Although they have their political leanings, national radio usually attempts to present issues from a national perspective.<br/>  national broadcasters attract listenership across the country. National radio stations use highly standardized language and are very particular when selecting broadcasters in order to ensure neutrality.  </p>
<h5>(b)	Regional stations </h5>
<p> Regional radio stations in Kenya have emerged as an attempt by broadcasters to take care of a wide section of audience who are concentrated in a certain geographical area. Regional stations take advantage of shared culture, religion and language in a population.<br/>  For example, a number of radio stations broadcasting in the coastal part of Kenya such as Pwani FM, Radio Salaam, and Baraka FM have emerged and gained popularity providing stiff competition to the national stations such as KBC English and Radio Citizen. <br/> Whereas people in Coastal Kenya have different cultural backgrounds, the cultures are closely related.<br/>  They are also predominantly Muslim and use Swahili widely. Coastal people have a distinct music preferring genres such as<i> bango, bongo and taarab.</i> </p>
<p> Regional stations provide more news from the region to which they broadcast.<br/>  It is also worth noting that although vernacular stations do not meet the strict definition of a regional area, mainly because they broadcast to a homogeneous population, they also do assume a regional dimension.<br/>  Some tend to broadcast to one specific region and also dominate that area in terms of popularity. </p>
<h4>4.	Classification based on content </h4>
<h5>(a)	Split programmers </h5>
<p>Split programmers are those radio stations that emphasize information, education and entertainment content in their broadcasting.<br/>  Split programmers are usually stations that have a relatively wider reach.<br/>  They also broadcast to large group of audiences who have different needs and profiles. For national stations, the audiences belong to different cultural backgrounds, religion and economic class. Vernacular and regional audiences may belong to a common cultural background but from different economic and educational backgrounds. <br/> The main idea behind split programming is to meet the needs of the audiences which are diverse.<br/>  The composition of education, information, and education content vary in different stations. The national stations such as Radio Citizen, KBC English and KBC Swahili have more education and information and less entertainment.<br/>  Vernacular stations such as Inooro FM and Coro FM balance the three content types while Kameme FM has more entertainment than information and education. Except for KBC English, which devotes most time of the day during school sessions broadcasting educational content, split programmers have their content intermixed throughout the broadcasting hours.  </p>
<h5>(b)	Religious programmers </h5>
<p>Religious stations provide spiritual content to their audiences who are adherents of a certain faith. In Kenya, the religious stations are mainly Christian and Islam based. <br/> Due to a large Christian population in Kenya, most religious stations are also Christian.<br/>  Some of the stations identify themselves with a particular church while others broadcast to the general Christian population.<br/>  Some of Christian stations are individually owned while others are sponsored by religious organizations such as churches.<br/>  Some of the popular Christian stations include <br/> Family FM which is privately owned and broadcasts to a general Christian audience. <br/> Waumini FM broadcasts to Catholic audiences and is sponsored by the Catholic Church in Kenya <br/> while Hope FM is sponsored by Nairobi Pentecostal Church.<br/>  Biblia Husema FM is sponsored by the African Inland Church (AIC). <br/> Iqra FM broadcasts to the Muslim faithful. </p>
<h5>(c)	Entertainment/ Music programmers </h5>
<p>While most stations in Kenya have entertainment content in varying degrees, there are few stations that are purely devoted to entertainment programs such as Home Boyz Radio and Mtaa FM.<br/> <br/>  Both stations broadcast in Nairobi. These have emerged in Kenya in the last three years. These stations can also be referred to as music programmers because the bulk of their programming is music content with limited talk. <br/> 
	Their programming differs from entertainment-oriented urban FM stations, have a large proportion of music based on format. For instance, they have very few insertions such as advertisements during the music sessions and therefore tend to play continuously.  </p>
<p>Entertainment stations have more sessions where music is manipulated. Song arrangements go beyond ordinary fade-ins and fade-outs transition to incorporate techniques such as remixing and beat juggling (pauses, scratches, backspins, and delays). News is limited to entertainment news such as events, music releases, movie-guides, and celebrity gossip.  </p>
