<h3>INTRODUCTION TO RADIO AND TELEVISION COMMUNICATION </h3>
<h4>Definition of Terms  </h4>
<p> <i>Radio:</i> An electronic device designed to receive, demodulate, and amplify radio signals from sound broadcasting stations, etc. or an electronic device permitting both transmission and reception of radio signals for two-way communications. </p>
<p> <i>	Television (TV):</i> Broadcasting visual images of stationary or moving objects or an electronic device that receives television signals and displays them on a screen. </p>
<p><i>	Communication: </i>	Communication is giving, receiving or exchanging ideas, information, signals or messages through appropriate media, enabling individuals or groups to persuade, to seek information, to give information or to express emotions. </p>
<p><i>	Broadcasting:</i>	 Wikipedia (2010) defines broadcasting as the distribution of audio and video content to a dispersed audience via radio, television, or other, often digital transmission media.<br/> According to Nwadigwe (2006) broadcasting is the sharing of information through electronic devices. Broadcast by television medium is known as telecast. </p>

<h3>Characteristics of Radio </h3>
<p> 	<b>Radio has speed. </b>It is the fastest in terms of giving the breaking news. It can easily provide something new and surprise the listener.<br/> When people tune to a radio they know what to expect but creative and stimulating producers can give something new. <br/>Radio can move with people’s feelings or moods i.e. where a caller makes a request following their suffering. <br/>The fact that the presenter cannot be seen allows them the freedom to surprise listeners with the kind of things said. </p>
<p> 	<b>Radio can suffer from interference.</b> Radio can easily suffer fading and co-channel may vary the AM at night.<br/> Quality of sound received may vary from that carefully produced and balanced in the studio.<br/> Reception in a moving vehicle is difficult due to varying signal strength. </p>
<p>	<b>Radio has no boundaries.</b> Radio does not respect territorial limits. Its signals can go over mountains and across oceans.<br/> It can transcend the territorial boundaries and link up different communities or nationalities. Print media can be stopped at national frontiers.  </p>
<p>	<b>Radio is local and portable.</b> Can speak all languages. It can operate within a small locality and address the needs of a community and speak their language. It is small in size and one can move around with it.  </p>
<p>	<b>Radio is a secondary medium.</b> Radio can be used as background while the listener is busy engaging in other activities.<br/> It is less demanding as it permits one to undertake other things at the same time. This generosity makes it interruptible. This leads to low level of commitment on the part of the listeners.  </p>
<p>	<b>Radio is a simple technology. </b>It requires very simple technology including the mixer, microphone, transmission equipment and computer system.<br/> This technology is simple to operate and even non-professionals can be involved. <br/>These simplicity allows for flexibility in programming since changes on programs can be done on short notice.  </p>
<p>	<b>Radio is cheap.</b> The capital and running cost for radio and radio stations is relatively cheap. In many countries getting a transmission frequency may be more difficult than having the finance.<br/> Frequencies are not easily assigned.<br/> The cost of buying a radio and operating it as an audience is low thus attracting a substantial audience. The large number of audience makes the cost per listener for advertisers and sponsors low.<br/> Radio is cheaper than books, newspapers, TV, Internet and mobile phone.  </p>
<p>	<b>Radio is highly segmented. </b>The low cost of putting the radio station has encouraged many investors. <br/>To cut out a market for your communication product requires segmentation of the mass. This tough competition for audience has led to a highly segmented audience that may imply small audience size for each radio station.  </p>
<p><b>	Radio is transient in nature.</b> The medium demands you must be there to get the content. If you miss details and do not understand everything it is gone and unless you wait for it to be repeated latter. <br/>This encourages misinterpretation and taking of content out of context. <br/>The broadcaster has to keep a record of all content broadcasted in order to safeguard against allegations of malpractice. The transient nature requires that producers and presenters have clear ideas and use simple language.  </p>
<p><b>Radio lacks space.</b> If a newspaper has a lot of material it can increase its pagination to create space. This will encourage detailed coverage. However, with radio you cannot increase time to create space for more material.<br/> An increase in one material will mean removing some programs as time is a constant (24 hours)  </p>
<p> <b>Radio makes pictures.<br/></b> Radio stimulates imagination. Listeners use the voices to visualize what they hear and the bearer of the voice. The pictures are limited by the use of the size of one’s imagination. However, the visions are liable to distortions due to selectivity.<br/> The radio writer must choose words that will create the right picture in the listener’s mind. </p>
<p><b>Radio speaks to individuals.</b> It is a narrow casting medium.<br/> Radio is personal and can speak directly to the listeners.<br/> One can listen to the radio as an individual and be linked to other people who are listening especially if it is a live transmission. For example, greetings.  </p>
<p><b>Radio speaks to many.</b> It is a mass medium. Radio has a large reach as many people own the radio since it is cheap.  </p>

<h5>Advantages of Radio Advantages of radio </h5>
<p>•	Can be operated on dry cell making it more affordable</p>
<p>•	High in reach in terms of geographical, stratification, educational level due to high segmentation  </p>
<p>•	It can be used by both literate and illiterate .  </p>
<p>•	it has a faster feedback and is more interactive than TV .  </p>
<p>•	it is portable, thus increasing listenership .  </p>
<p>•	Minimum operational knowledge in production and by the end user.   </p>
<p>•	One can listen as s/he does other tasks, since it is a secondary medium  </p>

<h5>Disadvantage of TV </h5>
<p>•	The message is transcient and temporal and might require multiple exposure to be understood clearly </p>
<p>•	Requires operational knowledge as it employs complex technology. </p>
<p>•	Prone to technical hitches  </p>
<p>•	Prolonged exposure may cause health problems e.g. visual problem ,obesity, since it is a passive medium </p>
<p>•	Costly elitist in nature- speaks to the rich in society. </p>
<p>•	It requires more power (electricity, solar energy) to operate  </p>
<p> •	It reduces the tendency to read especially books </p>
<p>•	It reduces our imagination unlike books and radio that stimulate our imagination is less interactive compared to radio since its mostly recorded, not live programmes  </p>
<p>•	It is expensive to purchase, produce programmes and even operate and maintain  </p>
<p>•	It helps to reconstruct reality and sometimes the narrow depiction of reality influences the society.  </p>
<p> •	It demands attention as it requires a captive audience, thus reducing viewership due to other activities </p>
