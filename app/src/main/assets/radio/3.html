<h3>NEWS AND NEWS GATHERING</h3>
<p><b>Definition of News </b></p>
<p>•	News is a combination of facts and events of current importance to the audience of the media outlet. </p>
<p> •	News is any event, idea or opinion that is timely, that interests/affects a large number of people in a community and that is capable of being understood by them.</p>
<h5>
News Values
</h5>
<p> News values are general guidelines or criteria that determine the worth of a news story and how much prominence it is given by newspapers or broadcast media.<br/>  They are fundamental to understanding news production and the choices that editors and other journalists face when deciding that one bit of information is news while another is not.
News values refer to the elements that help determine whether a story is news worthy.<br/> . An item may have more than one news value. <br/> .The more the news value, the more news worthy the event is.
</p>
<p>•	<b>Impact</b>. <br/> A plane crash that kills 180 people is more newsworthy than an automobile accident that kills two.<br/> <br/>  The number of people whose lives will be affected by the subject of the story e.g. a bakery strike may have less impact than a police strike. Reporters stress important information that has an impact on their audience i.e. stories that affect, involve or interest thousands of readers or viewers. </p>
<p> •	<b>Consequence</b>.<br/>  For example, a pay rise of MPs is of great consequence to both the cabinet and public which foots the bill.<br/> <br/>  A story that affects every reader will have more consequence than one that affects only a few. Reporters emphasize the angle of the story that will impact most readers.</p>
<p>•<b>	Immediacy or timeliness.</b><br/>  Reporters emphasize most recent or newest angle of a story. Recent happenings have higher news values than earlier happenings.<br/> <br/>  Stories brought out to the public ahead of competition are very valuable. They are known as scoops. <br/> A story that has just happened is news; <br/> one that has happened a few days ago is history. A newspaper looks foolish if it publishes a news story and after reading it, a reader says I heard it four days ago. However, an event that occurred sometime ago may still be timely if it has just been revealed. Even if a story occurred a day earlier, journalists will look for fresh information around which to build their stories.<br/>  In summary, timeliness is that which is current, fresh, and topical and it comes at a time when it is expected, relevant etc. It is that which takes on a new face or aspect or when it has a new angle though it may have happened a long time ago is very timely. Timeliness is that which is current, fresh, and topical and it comes at a time when it is expected, relevant etc. It is that which takes on a new face or aspect or when it has a new angle though it may have happened a long time ago is very timely. </p>
<p> •	<b>Currency</b>.<br/>  More value is attributed to stories pertaining to issues or topics that are in the spotlight of public concern rather than those issues or topics about which people care less.</p>
<p>•	<b>Emotion, instincts or human interest.</b><br/>  The story that covers/touches all the feelings that human beings have, including happiness, sadness, anger, sympathy, ambition, hate, love, envoy, generosity and humor. <br/> Readers enjoy stories that appeal to their emotions.<br/>  Stories about the homeless, babies needing transplants, a 4-year-old girl abandoned in freezing weather who must have her legs amputated, baby girls rescued from wells, someone winning the lottery etc. </p>
<p>•	<b>Prominence.</b> <br/> The more prominent a particular name, place, event or situation, the more interest the story will have. The story of when the President is involved in an accident vs. an obscure person/ a nobody.  </p>
<p>•<b>	Proximity.</b> Readers are more interested in an event geographically near them than in one far removed. <br/> Stories about events and situations in one’s home community are more newsworthy than events taking place far away.<br/>  Readers are interested in what happens close to them.<br/>  Reporters emphasize the local angle whenever possible. Thus, proximity is the nearness of an event to the readers or listeners and how closely it touches their lives. </p>
<p>•	<b>Oddity/ Unusualness/Bizarreness.</b> <br/> “When a dog bites a man that is not news but when a man bites a dog that is news.”<br/>  If an ordinary pilot parachuted out of an ordinary plane with an ordinary parachute and made an ordinary landing, then there are no real news values. But if the parachute fails to open and the pilot lands safely then there is news. <br/> The greater the degree of unusualness in a story, the greater its news value. The unusual or strange will help lift a story out of the ordinary. </p>
<p> •	<b>Conflict or controversy.</b> <br/> Appears frequently in news stories. Inherent in sports stories, war news, crime news, violence, domestic disputes, government bodies.<br/>  Conflict can be physical or mental. (Ideas can be in conflict). Can involve man vs. man, man vs. nature, man vs. animal or animal vs. animal.</p>
<p>•	<b>Sex.</b><br/>  Sometimes sex is the biggest single element or at least it appears to be the element that attracts readers most.<br/>  Consider all stories that involve men and women- sports, financial news, society and crime. News element present in stories of romance, marriage, divorce and other relationships. The treatment of sex varies widely from publication to publication. </p>
