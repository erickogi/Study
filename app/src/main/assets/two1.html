   	<h3>What is Software Engineering?</h3>
<h4>Definitions:</h4>
<p>1	The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. (IEEE, 1990)</p>
<p>2	A discipline that adopts engineering approaches, such as established methodologies, processes, tools, standards, organization methods, management methods, quality assurance systems, in the development of large-scale software seeking to result in high productivity, low cost, controllable quality, and measurable development schedule.</p>
<p>3	An engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production. Multi-person construction of multi-version software.</p>

<h3>Challenges facing Software Engineering</h3>
<h4>Software Engineering in the 21st Century faces 3 key challenges;</h4>
<h5>1.	Heterogeneity challenge:<br/></h5>
<p>:	Developing techniques for building software that can cope with heterogeneous platforms and execution environments – integrate new software with older legacy systems.</p>
<h5>2.	Delivery challenge:</h5>
<p>:	Developing techniques that lead to faster delivery of software – shortening delivery times for large and complex systems without compromising system quality.</p>
<h5>3.	Trust challenge:</h5>
<p>	Developing techniques that demonstrate that software can be trusted by its users – software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives.<br/></p>
<h4>WHAT ARE THE OTHER CHALLENGES?</h4>
