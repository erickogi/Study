   	<h3>	Exploratory development</h3> 
<p>The objective is to work with customers and to evolve a final system from an initial outline specification. <br/>Should start with well-understood requirements and add new features as proposed by the customer.</p>
<h3>4.	Throw-away prototyping</h3>
<p>Objective is to understand the system requirements. Should start with poorly understood requirements to clarify what is really needed.</p>

</div>
<h4>	Problems and Applicability of Evolutionary development</h4>
<p>1	Lack of process visibility</p>
<p>2	Systems are often poorly structured</p>
<p>3	Special skills (e.g. in languages for rapid prototyping) may be required</p>
<p>4	Applicability</p>
<p>5	For small or medium-size interactive systems</p>
<p>6	For parts of large systems (e.g. the user interface)</p>
<p>7	For short-lifetime systems</p>
<h4>These tasks are common to all the models</h4>
<p>1.	Communication: helps to understand the objective.</p>
<p>2.	Planning: required as many people (software teams) work on the same project but different function at same time.</p>
<p>3.	Modeling: involves business modeling, data modeling, and process modeling.</p>
<p>4.	Construction: this involves the reuse software components and automatic code.</p>
<p>5.	Deployment: integration</p>
