   	<h1>LECTURE 1 - What is Software?</h1>
<h3>Definitions:</h3>
<p>•	The organization of a set of tasks and functionality encapsulated into a form that is executable on a computer.</p>
<p>•	Computer programs, procedures, algorithms and associated documentation such as requirements, design models and user manuals.</p>
<p>•	Programs are an ordered sequence of instructions for changing the state of the computer in a particular sequence.</p>
<p>•	Programs usually written in High Level Languages that are easier and more efficient for humans to use than machine language.
</p>
<h3>Classification of Software</h3>
<p>
<p>1.	Generic – developed to be sold to a range of different customers</p>
<p>2.	Bespoke (Custom) – developed for a single customer according to their specification.</p>
<p>3.	Others:</p>
<p>•	Commercial-Off-the-shelf (COTS) – Retail</p>
<p>•	Government-Off-the-shelf (GOTS)<p>
<p>•	Legacy - written in an “Old” Programming Language eg. Cobol, Fortran, C, etc.</p>
<p>•	Proprietary</p>
<p>•	Open-Source</p>
<p>•	Shareware</p>
<p>•	Freeware
</p>
<h3>Types of Software</h3>
<h5>1.	System Software </h5>
<p>•	operating system</p> 
<p>•	utility programs </P>
<p>•	servers<br/> </p>
•	etc 

<h5>2.	Application Software </h5>
<p>•	DBMS</p>
<p>•	Browsers</p>
<p>•	Packages</p>
<h5>3.	Programming Software</h5> 
<p>•	compilers</p>
<p>•	interpreters</p>
<p>•	debuggers</p>
<p>•	linkers</p>
<p>•	text editors</p>
<h3>Nature of Software</h3>
<p>•	Software is flexible: an executable specification of a computation.</p>
<p>•	Software is expensive: all computable functions may be expressed in software. Complex event driven systems may be expressed in software.</p>
<p>•	Software is huge: eg. an operating system may consist of millions of lines of code.</p>
<p>•	Software is complex: software has little regularity or recognizable components found in other complex systems and there are exponentially many paths through the code and changes in one part of the code may have unintended consequences in other equally remote sections of the code.</p>
<p>•	Software is cheap: manufacturing cost is zero, development cost is everything.</p> 
<p>•	Software is never finished: the changing requirements and ease of modification permits the maintenance phase to dominate a software product’s life cycle.</p>
<p>•	Software is easily modified: we can use various development processes to uncover errors in design and the requirements.</p>
<p>•	Software is communication: communication with a machine but also communication between the client, the software architect, the software engineer, and the coder. Software must be readable in order to be evolvable.</p>

<h3>Role of Software</h3>
<p>•	Software is a product as well as a service – a vehicle that delivers a product.</p>
<p>•	As a product, it is different from traditional types of products</p>
<p>•	Intangible - difficult to describe and evaluate</p>
<p>•	Malleable soft, flexible</p>
<p>•	Human intensive - involves only trivial “manufacturing” process</p>
<p>•	It delivers the computing potential embodied by computer hardware or more broadly network of computers accessible by local hardware.</p>
<h5>As a vehicle for delivering products, software acts as the basis for the:</h5>	
<p>1	control of the computer (operating systems)</p>
<p>2	the communications of information (networks) and</p> 
<p>3	the creation and control of other programs (software tools and environments).</p>
