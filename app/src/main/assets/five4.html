<h3>Prototype model</h3>
<p>The idea here is that instead of freezing the requirements before a design or coding can proceed, a throwaway prototype is built to understand the requirements.<br/> This prototype is developed based on the currently known requirements.</p>
<p> By using this prototype, the client can get an “actual feel” of the system, since the interactions with prototype can enable the client to better understand the requirements of the desired system.  Prototyping is an attractive idea for complicated and large systems for which there is no manual process or existing system to help determining the requirements. </p>
<p>The prototype are usually not complete systems and many of the details are not built in the prototype. The goal is to provide a system with overall functionality.</p>

</div>
<h4>Advantages of Prototype model:</h4>
<p>•	Users are actively involved in the development</p>
<p>•	Since in this methodology a working model of the system is provided, the users get a better understanding of the system being developed.</p>
<p>•	Errors can be detected much earlier.</p>
<p>•	Quicker user feedback is available leading to better solutions.</p>
<p>•	Missing functionality can be identified easily</p>
<p>•	Confusing or difficult functions can be identified</p>
<p>Requirements validation, Quick implementation of, incomplete, but
functional, application.</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Prototype model:</h4>
<p>•	Leads to implementing and then repairing way of building systems.</p>
<p>•	Practically, this methodology may increase the complexity of the system as scope of the system may expand beyond original plans.</p>
<p>•	Incomplete application may cause application not to be used as the
full system was designed</p>
<p>.Incomplete or inadequate problem analysis.</p> 
<h4>When to use Prototype model: </h4>  
<p>•	Prototype model should be used when the desired system needs to have a lot of interaction with the end users.</p>
<p>•	Typically, online systems, web interfaces have a very high amount of interaction with end users, are best suited for Prototype model.<br/> It might take a while for a system to be built that allows ease of use and needs minimal training for the end user.</p>
<p>•	Prototyping ensures that the end users constantly work with the system and provide a feedback which is incorporated in the prototype to result in a useable system. <br/>They are excellent for designing good human computer interface systems.</p>

<h3>Spiral model</h3>
<p>The spiral model is similar to the incremental model, with more emphasis placed on risk analysis. The spiral model has four phases: Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering and Evaluation.</p>
<p> A software project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations (called Spirals in this model). </p>
<p>The baseline spiral, starting in the planning phase, requirements are gathered and risk is assessed. Each subsequent spirals builds on the baseline spiral. </p>
<p>Planning Phase: Requirements are gathered during the planning phase. Requirements like ‘BRS’ that is ‘Bussiness Requirement Specifications’ and ‘SRS’ that is ‘System Requirement specifications’.</p>
<p>Risk Analysis: In the risk analysis phase, a process is undertaken to identify risk and alternate solutions.  A prototype is produced at the end of the risk analysis phase. If any risk is found during the risk analysis then alternate solutions are suggested and implemented.</p>
<p>Engineering Phase: In this phase software is developed, along with testing at the end of the phase. Hence in this phase the development and testing is done.</p>
<p>Evaluation phase: This phase allows the customer to evaluate the output of the project to date before the project continues to the next spiral.</p>

<h4>Advantages of Spiral model:</h4>
<p>•	High amount of risk analysis hence, avoidance of Risk is enhanced.</p>
<p>•	Good for large and mission-critical projects.</p>
<p>•	Strong approval and documentation control.</p>
<p>•	Additional Functionality can be added at a later date.</p>
<p>•	Software is produced early in the software life cycle.</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Spiral model:</h4>
<p>•	Can be a costly model to use.</p>
<p>•	Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise.</p>
<p>•	Project’s success is highly dependent on the risk analysis phase.</p>
<p>•	Doesn’t work well for smaller projects.</p>
 <h4>When to use Spiral model:</h4>
<p>•	When costs and risk evaluation is important</p>
<p>•	For medium to high-risk projects</p>
<p>•	Long-term project commitment unwise because of potential changes to economic priorities</p>
<p>•	Users are unsure of their needs</p>
<p>•	Requirements are complex</p>
<p>•	New product line</p>
<p>•	Significant changes are expected (research and exploration)</p>
