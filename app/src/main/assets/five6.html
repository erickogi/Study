<h3>Estimation Guidelines</h3>
<p>One should keep the following guidelines in mind while estimating a project −</p>
<br/>
<p>•	During estimation, ask other people's experiences. Also, put your own experiences at task.</p>
<p>•	Assume resources will be productive for only 80 percent of their time. Hence, during estimation take the resource utilization as less than 80%.</p>
<p>•	Resources working on multiple projects take longer to complete tasks because of the time lost switching between them.</p>
<p>•	Include management time in any estimate.</p>
<p>•	Always build in contingency for problem solving, meetings and other unexpected events.</p>
<p>•	Allow enough time to do a proper project estimate. Rushed estimates are inaccurate, high-risk estimates. <br/>For large development projects, the estimation step should really be regarded as a mini project.</p>
<p>•	Where possible, use documented data from your organization’s similar past projects. It will result in the most accurate estimate.<br/> If your organization has not kept historical data, now is a good time to start collecting it.</p>
<p>•	Use developer-based estimates, as the estimates prepared by people other than those who will do the work will be less accurate.</p>
<p>•	Use several different people to estimate and use several different estimation techniques.</p>
<p>•	Reconcile the estimates. Observe the convergence or spread among the estimates.<br/> Convergence means that you have got a good estimate. Wideband-Delphi technique can be used to gather and discuss estimates using a group of people, the intention being to produce an accurate, unbiased estimate.</p>
