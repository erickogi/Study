<h3>Potential CASE Tool Costs</h3>
<p>•	Initial training and education</p>
<p>•	Evaluation costs</p>
<p>•	Maintenance of the model over time (it's even worse when the model has outlasted its usefulness but you're still maintaining it for posterity)</p>
<p>•	Upgrade costs of the tool</p>
<p>•	Ongoing usage/maintenance fees</p>
<p>•	Time lost waiting for the tool to do its job</p>
<p>•	Time lost over-using the tool (e.g. making your diagrams look pretty, extraneous information, and so on)</p>
<p>•	Migration costs to port models to another tool</p>
<p>•	Increased effort to synchronize models with other artifacts, such as source code</p>
<p>•	CASE tools often promote syntax over communication between developers (in other words, your model looks good but doesn't necessarily work)</p>
<p>•	Generated code often too simplistic, or cluttered with extraneous information required by the tool</p>
<p>•	Poor user interfaces often hamper the modeling effort</p>
<p>•	Inadequate integration with other tools reduces productivity and/or requires integration work</p>
<p>•	Complex tools are often prevent the inclusion of non-developers in your modeling efforts </p>
<h3>Potential CASE Tool Benefits</h3>
<p>•	Forward engineering (code generation)</p>
<p>•	Reverse engineering of existing code</p>
<p>•	Support for changing levels of abstraction (e.g. from requirements to analysis to design to code)</p>
<p>•	Testing of the consistency and validity of your models</p>
<p>•	Synchronization of models with delivered code</p>
<p>•	Support for different views and/or potential solutions to a problem</p>
<p>•	Generation of documentation</p>

<h3>The Future of CASE Tools</h3>
<p>As software engineering becomes more complex, and  businesses seeking to be as cost-efficient as possible, the need for CASE tool knowledge, complex in itself, will continue to be important.</p>

<p>Many studies have been done on the use of CASE tools, and the results point to their benefit but with the importance of correct use by a strong software developer. In other words, they do not ensure that anyone can write a good computer system, but they enable experienced software developers to do an even better job. </p>
