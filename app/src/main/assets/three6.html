<h3>Estimation Accuracy</h3>
<p>Accuracy is an indication of how close something is to reality. </p>
<p>Whenever you generate an estimate, everyone wants to know how close the numbers are to reality. <br/>
You will want every estimate to be as accurate as possible, given the data you have at the time you generate it. And of course you don’t want to present an estimate in a way that inspires a false sense of confidence in the numbers.</p>
<p><i>Important factors that affect the accuracy of estimates are −</i></p>
<p>•	The accuracy of all the estimate’s input data.</p>
<p>•	The accuracy of any estimate calculation.</p>
<p>•	How closely the historical data or industry data used to calibrate the model matches the project you are estimating.</p>
<p>•	The predictability of your organization’s software development process.</p>
<p>•	The stability of both the product requirements and the environment that supports the software engineering effort.</p>
<p>•	Whether or not the actual project was carefully planned, monitored and controlled, and no major surprises occurred that caused unexpected delays.</p>
<p>Following are some guidelines for achieving reliable estimates −</p>
<br/>
<p>•	Base estimates on similar projects that have already been completed.</p>
<p>•	Use relatively simple decomposition techniques to generate project cost and effort estimates.</p>
<p>•	Use one or more empirical estimation models for software cost and effort estimation.</p>
<p><i><u>Refer to the section on Estimation Guidelines in this chapter.</u></i></p>
<p>To ensure accuracy, you are always advised to estimate using at least two techniques and compare the results.</p>
