   	<h3>Common CASE risks and associated controls include:</h3>
<p>•	Inadequate Standardization - Linking CASE tools from different vendors (design tool from Company X, programming tool from Company Y) may be difficult if the products do not use standardized code structures and data classifications.</p>
<p> File formats can be converted, but usually not economically. Controls include using tools from the same vendor, or using tools based on standard protocols and insisting on demonstrated compatibility. Additionally, if organizations obtain tools for only a portion of the development process, they should consider acquiring them from a vendor that has a full line of products to ensure future compatibility if they add more tools.</p>
<p>•	Unrealistic Expectations - Organizations often implement CASE technologies to reduce development costs. Implementing CASE strategies usually involves high start-up costs. Generally, management must be willing to accept a long-term payback period.</p>
<p> Controls include requiring senior managers to define their purpose and strategies for implementing CASE technologies.</p>
<p>•	Quick Implementation - Implementing CASE technologies can involve a significant change from traditional development environments. </p>
<p>Typically, organizations should not use CASE tools the first time on critical projects or projects with short deadlines because of the lengthy training process. Additionally, organizations should consider using the tools on smaller, less complex projects and gradually implementing the tools to allow more training time.</p>
<p>•	Weak Repository Controls - Failure to adequately control access to CASE repositories may result in security breaches or damage to the work documents, system designs, or code modules stored in the repository. </p>
<p>Controls include protecting the repositories with appropriate access, version, and backup controls.</p>
