<h1>LECTURE 5 CASE TOOLS</h1>

<p>CASE stands for Computer Aided Software Engineering. It means, development and maintenance of software projects with help of various automated software tools. </p>
<p>•	Software design is usually completed with at least some assistance from Computer-Aided Software Engineering tools, or CASE tools. </p>
<p>•	CASE is the use of computer-based support by developers to develop and maintain software, especially on larger scale, or for more complex projects. </p>
<p>•	Systems have become more and more complex. </p>
<p>•	Using CASE allows designers, code writers, testers, planners, and managers to share a common view of where a project stands at each stage of development. </p>
<p>•	CASE helps ensure a disciplined, check-pointed process.</p> 
<p>•	There are number of CASE tools available to simplify various stages of Software Development Life Cycle such as Analysis tools, Design tools, Project management tools, Database Management tools, Documentation tools are to name a few. </p>
<p>•	A CASE tool may portray progress (or lack of it) graphically. </p>
<p>It may also serve as a repository for or be linked to document and program libraries containing the project's business plans, design requirements, design specifications, detailed code specifications, the code units, test cases and results, and marketing and service plans. </p>
<p>•	Utilizing CASE tools help make this possible for software developers.</p>
<p>•	Use of CASE tools accelerates the development of project to produce desired result and helps to uncover flaws before moving ahead with next stage in software development </p>

<p>The term CASE dates back to the early 1980s, when it was created by a corporation  that developed the first tools to evaluate software. Computer companies began to utilize ideas from hardware manufacturing and apply them toward the development of software.<br/> Ultimately the goal is to create software that will cost the company the least while still becoming the best product possible and meeting customer demands.</p>
