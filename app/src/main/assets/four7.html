<h3>WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES OF A GOOD PROJECT MANAGER?</h3>

<h4>1. Command authority naturally.</h4>
<p>In other words, they don’t need borrowed power to enlist the help of others – they just know how to do it.<br/> They are optimistic leaders who are viewed in a favorable light and are valued by the organization.</p>
<h4>2. Possess quick sifting abilities, knowing what to note and what to ignore.</h4>
<p>The latter is more important since there’s almost always too much data, and rarely too little. Ignoring the right things is better than trying to master extraneous data.</p>
<h4>3. Set, observe, and re-evaluate project priorities frequently.</h4>
<p>They focus and prioritize by handling fewer emails, attending fewer meetings, and generally limiting their data input.</p>
<h4>4. Ask good questions and listen to stakeholders.</h4>
<p>Great project managers don’t just go through the motions. They care about communication and the opinions of the parties involved. <br/>They are also sufficiently self-aware to know how their communication is received by those stakeholders.</p>
<h4>5. Do not use information as a weapon or a means of control.</h4>
<p>They communicate clearly, completely, and concisely. All the while giving others real information without fear of what they’ll do with it.</p>
<h4>6. Adhere to predictable communication schedules</h4>
<p>…recognizing that it’s the only deliverable early in a project cycle. All this takes place after very thorough pre-execution planning to eliminate as many variables as possible.</p>
<h4>7. Possess domain expertise in project management as applied to a particular field.</h4>
<p>It’s not just that they have generic project management skills; they have a deep familiarity with one or multiple fields that gives them a natural authority and solid strategic insight.</p>
<h4>8. Exercise independent and fair consensus-building skills when conflict arises.</h4>
<p>But they embrace only as much conflict as is absolutely necessary, neither avoiding nor seeking grounds for control of a particular project segment.</p>
<h4>9. Cultivate and rely on extensive informal networks inside and outside the firm to solve problems that arise.</h4>
<p>They identify any critical issues that threaten projects and handle them resolutely (vs. ignoring them).</p>
<h4>10. Look forward to going to work!</h4>
<p>They believe that project management is an exciting challenge that’s critical to success. The truly great ones view project management as a career and not a job, and they treat it like so by seeking additional training and education.</p>

<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>1	An organization structure is used to structure the communication patterns among members of a team</p>
<p>2	Traditional team organization is hierarchical with a manager supervising a group or groups of groups</p>
<p>3	Other organizations have been tried in software engineering with some success
</p>
<h4>Chief-programmer teams</h4>
<p>1	A way to centralize the control of a software development team </p>
<p>2	chief programmer (CP) responsible for design + reports to peer manager responsible for administration </p>
<p>3	other members are a software librarian and programmers </p>
<p>4	report to C and are added to team when needed</p> 
<p>5	Best when the solution may be understood and controlled by one chief architect</p>
<h3>Team structure</h3>

</div>
<h4>Decentralized team organization</h4>
<p>1	Decisions are made by consensus, and all work is considered group work.</p>
<p>2	Members review each other’s work and are responsible as a group for what every member produces.   </p>
 <div class="erb-image-wrapper">
<img src="file:///android_asset/decentralized.png" alt="histogram" />
</div>
<p>3	Best when the problem or solution is not well-understood and requires the contribution of several people to clarify it.</p>
 

<h4>Mixed-control team organization</h4>
<p>1	Attempts to combine the benefits of centralized and decentralized control </p>
<p>2	Differentiates engineers into senior and junior</p>
<p>3	Senior engineer leads a group of juniors and reports to a project manager</p>
<p>4	Control vested in the project manager and senior programmers</p>
<p>5	Communication is decentralized among each set of individuals, peers, and their immediate supervisors </p>

<h3>Project Scheduling/Control</h3>
<p>1	Project Scheduling in a project refers to roadmap of all activities to be done with specified order and within time slot allotted to each activity. </p>
<p>2	Project managers tend to define various tasks, and project milestones and them arrange them keeping various factors in mind. <br/>They look for tasks lie in critical path in the schedule, which are necessary to complete in specific manner (because of task interdependency) and strictly within the time allocated.<br/> Arrangement of tasks which lies out of critical path are less likely to impact over all schedule of the project.</p>
<p>3	PS involves separating the total work involved in a project into separate activities and judging the time required to complete these activities.</p>
<p>	Work Breakdown Structure describes a break down of project goal into intermediate goals.</p>
<p>	Represented as a set of charts showing the work breakdown, activities dependencies and staff allocations. </p>
<p>For scheduling a project, it is necessary to -</p>
<p>•	Break down the project tasks into smaller, manageable form </p>
<p>•	Find out various tasks and correlate them</p>
<p>•	Estimate time frame required for each task</p>
<p>•	Divide time into work-units</p>
<p>•	Assign adequate number of work-units for each task</p>
<p>•	Calculate total time required for the project from start to finish</p>
<p>	Example: Class Projects</p>
