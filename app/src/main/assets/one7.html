<h1>LECTURE 7 - SOFTWARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT</h1>

<h2>What is Management?</h2>
<p>The creation and maintenance of an internal environment in an enterprise where individuals, working together in groups, can perform efficiently and effectively toward the attainment of group goals.</p>
<p>A project is well-defined task, which is a collection of several operations done in order to achieve a goal (for example, software development and delivery).</p> 
<p>A Project can be characterized as:</p>
<p>•	Every project may has a unique and distinct goal.</p>
<p>•	Project is not routine activity or day-to-day operations.</p>
<[>•	Project comes with a start time and end time.</p>
<p>•	Project ends when its goal is achieved hence it is a temporary phase in the lifetime of an organization.</p>
<p>•	Project needs adequate resources in terms of time, manpower, finance, material and knowledge-bank.</p>
<br/>
<p>A Software Project is the complete procedure of software development from requirement gathering to testing and maintenance, carried out according to the execution methodologies, in a specified period of time to achieve intended software product.</p>

<h4>Why Software Project Management?</h4>
<p>•	Professional SE is always subject to organizational budget and schedule constraints.</p>
<p>•	SPM’s job is to ensure that s/w projects meet these constraints and delivers s/w that contributes to the goals of the organization developing the s/w.</p>
<p>•	SE different from other engineering:</p>
<p>•	Product is intangible:  rely on others to produce the documentation needed too review progress.</p>
<p>•	No standard s/w processes: vary dramatically from one organization to another.</p>
<p>•	Large s/w projects are often one-off projects (cannot anticipate problems, rapid technological changes in ICT, each project different from other.</p>

<h4>Responsibilities that a project manager shoulders -
Managing People</h4>
<p>•	Act as project leader</p>
<p>•	Liaison with stakeholders</p>
<p>•	Managing human resources</p>
<p>•	Setting up reporting hierarchy etc.</p>
<h4>Managing Project</h4>
<p>•	Defining and setting up project scope</p>
<p>•	Managing project management activities</p>
<p>•	Monitoring progress and performance</p>
<p>•	Risk analysis at every phase</p>
<p>•	Take necessary step to avoid or come out of problems</p>
<p>•	Act as project spokesperson</p>

<h4>Management Activities</h4>
<p>SE jobs varies tremendously depending on the organization and the s/w product being developed. Activities</p>
<p>1	Proposal writing</p>
<p>2	Project planning and scheduling</p>
<p>3	Project cost</p>
<p>4	Project monitoring and reviews</p>
<p>5	Personnel selection and evaluation</p>
<p>6	Report writing and presentations</p>
<p>7	Project Managers select people to work on project. WHO?</p>

<p>2	Organizing</p>
<p>3	Staffing</p>
