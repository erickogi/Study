   	<h3>Project Risk Management</h4>
<p>Risk management involves all activities pertaining to identification, analyzing and making provision for predictable and non-predictable risks in the project.<br/>
 Risk may include the following:</p>
<p>•	Experienced staff leaving the project and new staff coming in.</p>
<p>•	Change in organizational management.</p>
<p>•	Requirement change or misinterpreting requirement.</p>
<p>•	Under-estimation of required time and resources.</p>
<p>•	Technological changes, environmental changes, business competition.</p>
<h3>Risk Management Process</h3>
<p>There are following activities involved in risk management process:</p>
<p>•	Identification - Make note of all possible risks, which may occur in the project.</p>
<p>•	Categorize - Categorize known risks into high, medium and low risk intensity as per their possible impact on the project.</p>
<p>•	Manage - Analyze the probability of occurrence of risks at various phases. Make plan to avoid or face risks. Attempt to minimize their side-effects.</p>
<p>•	Monitor - Closely monitor the potential risks and their early symptoms. Also monitor the effects of steps taken to mitigate or avoid them.</p>
<h3>Categories of Risks</h3>
<p>Project Risks: Affect the project schedule or resources eg. loss of an experienced designer.</p>
<p>Product Risks: Affect the quality or performance of the software being developed. Eg. failure of a purchased component to perform as expected.</p>
<p>Business Risks: Affect the organization developing or procuring the software. Eg. a competitor introducing a new product.</p>

<h3>Stages of Risk Management</h3>

<h4>Risk management process is an iterative process which continues throughout the project.</h4>
<p>1.	Risk Identification: Possible project, product and business risk identified</p>
<p>2.	Risk Analysis: The likelihood and consequences of these risks assessed, strategies identified to manage risks.</p>
<p>3.	Risk Monitoring: Plans to address the risk either by avoiding it or minimizing its effects on the project  are drawn up.</p>
<br/>
<p>o	Outcomes of risk management process are documented in a risk management plan.</p>

<h3>Project Execution & Monitoring</h3>
<p>In this phase, the tasks described in project plans are executed according to their schedules.
Execution needs monitoring in order to check whether everything is going according to the plan.</p>
<p> Monitoring is observing to check the probability of risk and taking measures to address the risk or report the status of various tasks.<br/>
These measures include -</p>
<p>•	Activity Monitoring - All activities scheduled within some task can be monitored on day-to-day basis. When all activities in a task are completed, it is considered as complete.</p>
<p>•	Status Reports - The reports contain status of activities and tasks completed within a given time frame, generally a week. Status can be marked as finished, pending or work-in-progress etc.</p>
<p>•	Milestones Checklist - Every project is divided into multiple phases where major tasks are performed (milestones) based on the phases of SDLC. This milestone checklist is prepared once every few weeks and reports the status of milestones.</p>
<h3>Project Communication Management</h3>
<p>Effective communication plays vital role in the success of a project. It bridges gaps between client and the organization, among the team members as well as other stake holders in the project such as hardware suppliers.</p>
<p>Communication can be oral or written. Communication management process may have the following <br/>steps: </p>
<p>•	Planning - <br/>This step includes the identifications of all the stakeholders in the project and the mode of communication among them. It also considers if any additional communication facilities are required.</p>
<p>•	Sharing - <br/>After determining various aspects of planning, manager focuses on sharing correct information with the correct person on correct time. This keeps every one involved the project up to date with project progress and its status.</p>
<p>•	Feedback -<br/> Project managers use various measures and feedback mechanism and create status and performance reports. <br/>This mechanism ensures that input from various stakeholders is coming to the project manager as their feedback.</p>
<p>•	Closure - <br/>At the end of each major event, end of a phase of SDLC or end of the project itself, administrative closure is formally announced to update every stakeholder by sending email, by distributing a hardcopy of document or by other mean of effective communication.</p>
<h3>Configuration Management</h3>
<p>Configuration management is a process of tracking and controlling the changes in software in terms of the requirements, design, functions and development of the product.</p>
<p>IEEE defines it as “the process of identifying and defining the items in the system, controlling the change of these items throughout their life cycle, recording and reporting the status of items and change requests, and verifying the completeness and correctness of items”.</p>
<p>Generally, once the SRS is finalized there is less chance of requirement of changes from user. If they occur, the changes are addressed only with prior approval of higher management, as there is a possibility of cost and time overrun.</p>
<h3>Baseline</h3>
<p>A phase of SDLC is assumed over if it baselined, i.e. baseline is a measurement that defines completeness of a phase.</p>
<p> A phase is baselined when all activities pertaining to it are finished and well documented. If it was not the final phase, its output would be used in next immediate phase.</p>
<p>Configuration management is a discipline of organization administration, which takes care of occurrence of any change (process, requirement, technological, strategical etc.) after a phase is baselined. CM keeps check on any changes done in software.</p>
<h3>Change Control</h3>
<p>Change control is function of configuration management, which ensures that all changes made to software system are consistent and made as per organizational rules and regulations.</p>
<p>A change in the configuration of product goes through following steps -</p>
<p>•	Identification - A change request arrives from either internal or external source. When change request is identified formally, it is properly documented.</p>
<p>•	Validation - Validity of the change request is checked and its handling procedure is confirmed.</p>
<p>•	Analysis - The impact of change request is analyzed in terms of schedule, cost and required efforts. Overall impact of the prospective change on system is analyzed.</p>
<p>•	Control - If the prospective change either impacts too many entities in the system or it is unavoidable, it is mandatory to take approval of high authorities before change is incorporated into the system. It is decided if the change is worth incorporation or not. If it is not, change request is refused formally.</p>
<p>•	Execution - If the previous phase determines to execute the change request, this phase take appropriate actions to execute the change, does a thorough revision if necessary.</p>
<p>•	Close request - The change is verified for correct implementation and merging with the rest of the system. </p>
