<h3>GUI Implementation Tools</h3>
<p>There are several tools available using which the designers can create entire GUI on a mouse click. <br/>Some tools can be embedded into the software environment (IDE).</p>
<p>GUI implementation tools provide powerful array of GUI controls. For software customization, designers can change the code accordingly.</p>
<p>There are different segments of GUI tools according to their different use and platform.</p>

<p>Example<br/>
Mobile GUI, Computer GUI, Touch-Screen GUI etc. Here is a list of few tools which come handy to build GUI:</p>
<p>•	FLUID</p>
<p>•	AppInventor (Android)</p>
<p>•	LucidChart</p>
<p>•	Wavemaker</p>
<p>•	Visual Studio</p>

<h4>User Interface Golden rules</h4>
<p><i>The following rules are mentioned to be the golden rules for GUI design, described by Shneiderman and Plaisant in their book (Designing the User Interface).</i></p>
<p>•	Strive for consistency - <br/>Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations. <br/>Identical terminology should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens. Consistent commands should be employed throughout.</p>
<P>•	Enable frequent users to use short-cuts - <br/>The user’s desire to reduce the number of interactions increases with the frequency of use. <br/>Abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands, and macro facilities are very helpful to an expert user.</p>
<p>•	Offer informative feedback - <br/>For every operator action, there should be some system feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response must be modest, while for infrequent and major actions, the response must be more substantial.</p>
<p>•	Design dialog to yield closure - <br/>Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end.<br/> The informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives the operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, the signal to drop contingency plans and options from their minds, and this indicates that the way ahead is clear to prepare for the next group of actions.</p>
<p>•	Offer simple error handling - <br/>As much as possible, design the system so the user will not make a serious error.</p> If an error is made, the system should be able to detect it and offer simple, comprehensible mechanisms for handling the error.</p>
<p>•	Permit easy reversal of actions - <br/>This feature relieves anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone. Easy reversal of actions encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. The units of reversibility may be a single action, a data entry, or a complete group of actions.</p>
<p>•	Support internal locus of control - <br/>Experienced operators strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the system and that the system responds to their actions. Design the system to make users the initiators of actions rather than the responders.</p>
<p>•	Reduce short-term memory load - <br/>The limitation of human information processing in short-term memory requires the displays to be kept simple, multiple page displays be consolidated, window-motion frequency be reduced, and sufficient training time be allotted for codes, mnemonics, and sequences of actions.</p>
