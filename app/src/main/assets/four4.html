   	<h3>RAD model</h3>
<p>RAD model is Rapid Application Development model.<br/> It is a type of incremental model. In RAD model the components or functions are developed in parallel as if they were mini projects.<br/> The developments are time boxed, delivered and then assembled into a working prototype.  This can quickly give the customer something to see and use and to provide feedback regarding the delivery and their requirements.</p>
<h4>Advantages of the RAD model:</h4>
<p>•	Reduced development time.</p>
<p>•	Increases reusability of components</p>
<p>•	Quick initial reviews occur</p>
<p>•	Encourages customer feedback</p>
<p>•	Integration from very beginning solves a lot of integration issues.</p>

<h4>Disadvantages of RAD model:</h4>
<p>•	Depends on strong team and individual performances for identifying business requirements.</p>
<p>•	Only system that can be modularized can be built using RAD</p>
<p>•	Requires highly skilled developers/designers.</p>
<p>•	High dependency on modeling skills</p>
<p>•	Inapplicable to cheaper projects as cost of modeling and automated code generation is very high.</p>
 
<h4>When to use RAD model:</h4>
<p>•	RAD should be used when there is a need to create a system that can be modularized in 2-3 months of time.</p>
<p>•	It should be used if there’s high availability of designers for modeling and the budget is high enough to afford their cost along with the cost of automated code generating tools.</p>
<p>•	RAD SDLC model should be chosen only if resources with high business knowledge are available and there is a need to produce the system in a short span of time (2-3 months).</p>

<h3>Agile model</h3>
<p>Agile development model is also a type of Incremental model.<br/> Software is developed in incremental, rapid cycles. This results in small incremental releases with each release building on previous functionality. Each release is thoroughly tested to ensure software quality is maintained. It is used for time critical applications. <br/> Extreme Programming (XP) is currently one of the most well known agile development life cycle model.</p>

<h4>Advantages of Agile model: </p>
<p>•	Customer satisfaction by rapid, continuous delivery of useful software.</p>
<p>•	People and interactions are emphasized rather than process and tools. Customers, developers and testers constantly interact with each other.</p>
<p>•	Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months).</p>
<p>•	Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication.</p>
<p>•	Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.</p>
<p>•	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.</p>
<p>•	Regular adaptation to changing circumstances.</p>
<p>•	Even late changes in requirements are welcomed</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Agile model:</h4>
<p>•	In case of some software deliverables, especially the large ones, it is difficult to assess the effort required at the beginning of the software development life cycle.</p>
<p>•	There is lack of emphasis on necessary designing and documentation.</p>
<p>•	The project can easily get taken off track if the customer representative is not clear what final outcome that they want.</p>
<p>•	Only senior programmers are capable of taking the kind of decisions required during the development process. Hence it has no place for newbie programmers, unless combined with experienced resources.</p>
<h4>When to use Agile model:</h4>
<p>•	When new changes are needed to be implemented.<br/> The freedom agile gives to change is very important. New changes can be implemented at very little cost because of the frequency of new increments that are produced.</p>
<p>•	To implement a new feature the developers need to lose only the work of a few days, or even only hours, to roll back and implement it.</p>
<p>•	Unlike the waterfall model in agile model very limited planning is required to get started with the project.<br/> Agile assumes that the end users’ needs are ever changing in a dynamic business and IT world.<br/> Changes can be discussed and features can be newly effected or removed based on feedback. This effectively gives the customer the finished system they want or need.
•	Both system developers and stakeholders alike, find they also get more freedom of time and options than if the software was developed in a more rigid sequential way.<br/> Having options gives them the ability to leave important decisions until more or better data or even entire hosting programs are available; meaning the project can continue to move forward without fear of reaching a sudden standstill.</p>
