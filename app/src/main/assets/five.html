 <h1>LECTURE 5 CASE TOOLS</h1>

<p>CASE stands for Computer Aided Software Engineering. It means, development and maintenance of software projects with help of various automated software tools. </p>
<p>•	Software design is usually completed with at least some assistance from Computer-Aided Software Engineering tools, or CASE tools. </p>
<p>•	CASE is the use of computer-based support by developers to develop and maintain software, especially on larger scale, or for more complex projects. </p>
<p>•	Systems have become more and more complex. </p>
<p>•	Using CASE allows designers, code writers, testers, planners, and managers to share a common view of where a project stands at each stage of development. </p>
<p>•	CASE helps ensure a disciplined, check-pointed process.</p> 
<p>•	There are number of CASE tools available to simplify various stages of Software Development Life Cycle such as Analysis tools, Design tools, Project management tools, Database Management tools, Documentation tools are to name a few. </p>
<p>•	A CASE tool may portray progress (or lack of it) graphically. </p>
<p>It may also serve as a repository for or be linked to document and program libraries containing the project's business plans, design requirements, design specifications, detailed code specifications, the code units, test cases and results, and marketing and service plans. </p>
<p>•	Utilizing CASE tools help make this possible for software developers.</p>
<p>•	Use of CASE tools accelerates the development of project to produce desired result and helps to uncover flaws before moving ahead with next stage in software development </p>

<p>The term CASE dates back to the early 1980s, when it was created by a corporation  that developed the first tools to evaluate software. Computer companies began to utilize ideas from hardware manufacturing and apply them toward the development of software.<br/> Ultimately the goal is to create software that will cost the company the least while still becoming the best product possible and meeting customer demands.</p>

<h3>Components of CASE Tools</h3>
<p>CASE tools can be broadly divided into the following parts based on their use at a particular SDLC stage:<.p>

<p>•	Central Repository - CASE tools require a central repository, which can serve as a source of common, integrated and consistent information.<br/> Central repository is a central place of storage where product specifications, requirement documents, related reports and diagrams, other useful information regarding management is stored. Central repository also serves as data dictionary.</p>
  <div class="erb-image-wrapper">
<img src="file:///android_asset/central.png" alt="central repository" />
</div>
<p>•	Upper Case Tools - Upper CASE tools are used in planning, analysis and design stages of SDLC.</p>
<p>•	Lower Case Tools - Lower CASE tools are used in implementation, testing and maintenance.</p>
<p>•	Integrated Case Tools - Integrated CASE tools are helpful in all the stages of SDLC, from Requirement gathering to Testing and documentation.</p>

<p>CASE tools can be grouped together if they have similar functionality, process activities and capability of getting integrated with other tools. </p>

<h4>Scope of Case Tools</h4>
<p>The scope of CASE tools goes throughout the SDLC.</p>

<h3>Case Tools Types</h3>

<h4>Diagram tools </h4>
<p>These tools are used to represent system components, data and control flow among various software components and system structure in a graphical form. For example, Flow Chart Maker tool for creating state-of-the-art flowcharts.</p>

<h4>Process Modeling Tools</h4>
<p>Process modeling is method to create software process model, which is used to develop the software.</p>
<p> Process modeling tools help the managers to choose a process model or modify it as per the requirement of software product. For example, EPF Composer</p>

<h4>Project Management Tools</h4>
<p>These tools are used for project planning, cost and effort estimation, project scheduling and resource planning. <p/>
<p>Managers have to strictly comply project execution with every mentioned step in software project management. Project management tools help in storing and sharing project information in real-time throughout the organization. For example, Creative Pro Office, Trac Project, Basecamp.</p>

<h4>Documentation Tools</h4>
<p>Documentation in a software project starts prior to the software process, goes throughout all phases of SDLC and after the completion of the project. </p>
<p>Documentation tools generate documents for technical users and end users. Technical users are mostly in-house professionals of the development team who refer to system manual, reference manual, training manual, installation manuals etc. The end user documents describe the functioning and how-to of the system such as user manual. For example, Doxygen, DrExplain, Adobe RoboHelp for documentation.
</p>
<h4>Analysis Tools</h4>
<p>These tools help to gather requirements, automatically check for any inconsistency, inaccuracy in the diagrams, data redundancies or erroneous omissions. For example, Accept 360, Accompa, CaseComplete for requirement analysis, Visible Analyst for total analysis</p>.

<h4>Design Tools</h4>
<p>These tools help software designers to design the block structure of the software, which may further be broken down in smaller modules using refinement techniques.</p>
<p> These tools provides detailing of each module and interconnections among modules. For example, Animated Software Design</p>

<h4>Configuration Management Tools</h4>
<p>An instance of software is released under one version. Configuration Management tools deal with –</p>
<p>•	Version and revision management </p>
<p>•	Baseline configuration management</p> 
<p>•	Change control management</p>
<p>CASE tools help in this by automatic tracking, version management and release management. For example, Fossil, Git, Accu REV.</p>

<h4>Change Control Tools</h4>
<p>These tools are considered as a part of configuration management tools.<br/>
 They deal with changes made to the software after its baseline is fixed or when the software is first released. </p>
 <p>CASE tools automate change tracking, file management, code management and more. It also helps in enforcing change policy of the organization.</p>

<h4>Programming Tools </h4>
<p>These tools consist of programming environments like IDE (Integrated Development Environment), in-built modules library and simulation tools. </p>
<P>These tools provide comprehensive aid in building software product and include features for simulation and testing. For example, Cscope to search code in C, Eclipse.</p>

<h4>Prototyping Tools </h4>
<p>Software prototype is simulated version of the intended software product.<br/> Prototype provides initial look and feel of the product and simulates few aspect of actual product.</p> 
<p>Prototyping CASE tools essentially come with graphical libraries. They can create hardware independent user interfaces and design. These tools help us to build rapid prototypes based on existing information. In addition, they provide simulation of software prototype. For example, Serena prototype composer, Mockup Builder.</p>

<h4>Web Development Tools</h4>
<p>These tools assist in designing web pages with all allied elements like forms, text, script, graphic and so on. </p>
<p>Web tools also provide live preview of what is being developed and how will it look after completion. For example, Fontello, Adobe Edge Inspect, Foundation 3, Brackets.</p>

<h4>Quality Assurance Tools</h4>
<p>Quality assurance in a software organization is monitoring the engineering process and methods adopted to develop the software product in order to ensure conformance of quality as per organization standards. QA tools consist of configuration and change control tools and software testing tools. For example, SoapTest, AppsWatch, JMeter.</p>

<h4>Maintenance Tools</h4>
<p>Software maintenance includes modifications in the software product after it is delivered.</p> <p>Automatic logging and error reporting techniques, automatic error ticket generation and root cause Analysis are few CASE tools, which help software organization in maintenance phase of SDLC. For example, Bugzilla for defect tracking, HP Quality Center.</p>

<h3>Common CASE risks and associated controls include:</h3>
<p>•	Inadequate Standardization - Linking CASE tools from different vendors (design tool from Company X, programming tool from Company Y) may be difficult if the products do not use standardized code structures and data classifications.</p>
<p> File formats can be converted, but usually not economically. Controls include using tools from the same vendor, or using tools based on standard protocols and insisting on demonstrated compatibility. Additionally, if organizations obtain tools for only a portion of the development process, they should consider acquiring them from a vendor that has a full line of products to ensure future compatibility if they add more tools.</p>
<p>•	Unrealistic Expectations - Organizations often implement CASE technologies to reduce development costs. Implementing CASE strategies usually involves high start-up costs. Generally, management must be willing to accept a long-term payback period.</p>
<p> Controls include requiring senior managers to define their purpose and strategies for implementing CASE technologies.</p>
<p>•	Quick Implementation - Implementing CASE technologies can involve a significant change from traditional development environments. </p>
<p>Typically, organizations should not use CASE tools the first time on critical projects or projects with short deadlines because of the lengthy training process. Additionally, organizations should consider using the tools on smaller, less complex projects and gradually implementing the tools to allow more training time.</p>
<p>•	Weak Repository Controls - Failure to adequately control access to CASE repositories may result in security breaches or damage to the work documents, system designs, or code modules stored in the repository. </p>
<p>Controls include protecting the repositories with appropriate access, version, and backup controls.</p>
<h3>Potential CASE Tool Costs</h3>
<p>•	Initial training and education</p>
<p>•	Evaluation costs</p>
<p>•	Maintenance of the model over time (it's even worse when the model has outlasted its usefulness but you're still maintaining it for posterity)</p>
<p>•	Upgrade costs of the tool</p>
<p>•	Ongoing usage/maintenance fees</p>
<p>•	Time lost waiting for the tool to do its job</p>
<p>•	Time lost over-using the tool (e.g. making your diagrams look pretty, extraneous information, and so on)</p>
<p>•	Migration costs to port models to another tool</p>
<p>•	Increased effort to synchronize models with other artifacts, such as source code</p>
<p>•	CASE tools often promote syntax over communication between developers (in other words, your model looks good but doesn't necessarily work)</p>
<p>•	Generated code often too simplistic, or cluttered with extraneous information required by the tool</p>
<p>•	Poor user interfaces often hamper the modeling effort</p>
<p>•	Inadequate integration with other tools reduces productivity and/or requires integration work</p>
<p>•	Complex tools are often prevent the inclusion of non-developers in your modeling efforts </p>
<h3>Potential CASE Tool Benefits</h3>
<p>•	Forward engineering (code generation)</p>
<p>•	Reverse engineering of existing code</p>
<p>•	Support for changing levels of abstraction (e.g. from requirements to analysis to design to code)</p>
<p>•	Testing of the consistency and validity of your models</p>
<p>•	Synchronization of models with delivered code</p>
<p>•	Support for different views and/or potential solutions to a problem</p>
<p>•	Generation of documentation</p>

<h3>The Future of CASE Tools</h3>
<p>As software engineering becomes more complex, and  businesses seeking to be as cost-efficient as possible, the need for CASE tool knowledge, complex in itself, will continue to be important.</p>

<p>Many studies have been done on the use of CASE tools, and the results point to their benefit but with the importance of correct use by a strong software developer. In other words, they do not ensure that anyone can write a good computer system, but they enable experienced software developers to do an even better job. </p>
