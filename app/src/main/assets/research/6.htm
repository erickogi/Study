<p class=MsoNormal><i><u>Population and Sampling</u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to refining concepts and measurements, you must decide who and what to study.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The population for a study is that group (usually of people)about whom we want to draw conclusions. We are never able to study all the members of a population…reasons?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We select a sample from the population. Note that decisions about population and sampling are related to the research method to be used..meaning?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whereas probability sampling techniques would be relevant to a large scale survey or content analysis, a field researcher might need to select only those informants who would yield a balanced of the situation under study and an experimenter might assign subjects to experimental and control groups in a manner that ensures comparability.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>Observations</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having decided what to study among whom by what method,
you’re now ready to make observations--to collect empirical data. Will you use questionnaires or interviews? The advantages and disadvantages of these will be discussed in later lessons.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b>Data Processing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The data collected will now need to be processed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, the data processing phase for a survey
typically involves the classification (coding) of written in answers and the transfer of all information to a computer.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b>Analysis</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, the collected data has to be interpreted in order to draw conclusions that reflect the interests, ideas and theories that initiated the inquiry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the results of the analysis will feed back into the initial interests, ideas and theories. In practice, this feedback may initiate another kind of enquiry (areas forfurther research).</p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b>Application</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the final stage of the research process It involves the uses made of the research and the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>conclusions arrived at.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Start by communicating the findings through a report or some other means, oral presentation-eg in a conference</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One can go further to not only report but also to discuss the implications of the findings-especially for decision making.</p>
