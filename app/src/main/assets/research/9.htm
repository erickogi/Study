<p class=MsoNormal><b>Literature Review as a Process</b></p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b>Components of Lit. Review</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---Development of the literature review requires four stages:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--<b>Problem formulation</b>-which topic or field is being examined and what are its component issues?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--<b>Literature search</b>-finding materials relevant to the subject being explored</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--<b>Data evaluation</b>-determining which literature makesa significant contribution to the understanding of the topic</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--<b>Analysis and interpretation</b>-discussing the findings and conclusions of pertinent literature</p>



<p class=MsoNormal><b>Sources of Literature</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Journal articles</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---these are good sources, especially for up-to-date
information.They are frequently used in literature reviews because they offer a relatively concise, up-to-date format for research.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---Depending on the publication,these materials may be
refereed materials.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal><i>What about Non-refereed Journals?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--Non-refereed materials such as Trade Journals, or
magazines use less rigorous standards of screening prior to publication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--Non-refereed materials may not be checked as intensely as refereed materials, but many can still be considered useful, although not for scientific literature and research.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal><i>Books</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>:remember that books tend to be less up-to-date, as it
takes longer for a book to be published than for a journal article.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---They are still likely to be useful for including in your literature review as they offer a good starting point from which to find more detailed and up-to-date sources of information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Conference proceedings</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>:these can be useful in providing the latest research, or research that has not been published.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---They are also helpful in providing information about
people indifferent research areas, and so can be helpful in tracking down other work by the same researchers.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal><i>Government/corporate reports</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---Many government departments and corporations commission carry out research.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---Their published findings can provide a useful source of information,depending on your field of study.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Theses and dissertations</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>:these can be useful sources of information. However there are disadvantages:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---they can be difficult to obtain since they are not published, but are generally only available from the library or interlibrary systems</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---the student who carried out the research may not be an experienced researcher and therefore you might have totreat their findings with more caution than published research.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal><i>Internet</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>:the fastest-growing source of information is on the Internet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--bear in mind that anyone can post information on the Internet so the quality may not be reliable e.g wikipedia</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--the information you find may be intended for a general audience and so not be suitable for inclusion in your literature review (information for a general audience is usually less detailed) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In assessing each piece, consideration should be given to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--Provenance-What are the author's credentials? Are the
author's arguments supported by evidence (e.g. primary historical material,case studies, narratives, statistics, recent scientific findings)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--Objectivity-Is the author's perspective even-handed or prejudicial? Is contrary data considered or is certain pertinent information ignored to prove the author's point?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--Persuasiveness-is the author's thesis convincing?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>--Value-Does the work ultimately contribute in any significant way to an understanding of the subject of my research?</p>
